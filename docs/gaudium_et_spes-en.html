&nbsp;<P><B> PREFACE</B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1. The joys and the hopes, the griefs and the anxieties of the men of this 
age, especially those who are poor or in any way afflicted, these are the joys 
and hopes, the griefs and anxieties of the followers of Christ. Indeed, nothing 
genuinely human fails to raise an echo in their hearts. For theirs is a 
community composed of men. United in Christ, they are led by the Holy Spirit in 
their journey to the Kingdom of their Father and they have welcomed the news of 
salvation which is meant for every man. That is why this community realizes that 
it is truly linked with mankind and its history by the deepest of bonds.
</P>
<P>2. Hence this Second Vatican Council, having probed more profoundly into the 
mystery of the Church, now addresses itself without hesitation, not only to the 
sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of 
humanity. For the council yearns to explain to everyone how it conceives of the 
presence and activity of the Church in the world of today.
</P>
<P>Therefore, the council focuses its attention on the world of men, the whole 
human family along with the sum of those realities in the midst of which it 
lives; that world which is the theater of man's history, and the heir of his 
energies, his tragedies and his triumphs; that world which the Christian sees as 
created and sustained by its Maker's love, fallen indeed into the bondage of 
sin, yet emancipated now by Christ, Who was crucified and rose again to break 
the strangle hold of personified evil, so that the world might be fashioned anew 
according to God's design and reach its fulfillment.</P>
<P>3. Though mankind is stricken with wonder at its own discoveries and its 
power, it often raises anxious questions about the current trend of the world, 
about the place and role of man in the universe, about the meaning of its 
individual and collective strivings, and about the ultimate destiny of reality 
and of humanity. Hence, giving witness and voice to the faith of the whole 
people of God gathered together by Christ, this council can provide no more 
eloquent proof of its solidarity with, as well as its respect and love for the 
entire human family with which it is bound up, than by engaging with it in 
conversation about these various problems. The council brings to mankind light 
kindled from the Gospel, and puts at its disposal those saving resources which 
the Church herself, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, receives from her 
Founder. For the human person deserves to be preserved; human society deserves 
to be renewed. Hence the focal point of our total presentation will be man 
himself, whole and entire, body and soul, heart and conscience, mind and will.</P>
<P>Therefore, this sacred synod, proclaiming the noble destiny of man and 
championing the Godlike seed which has been sown in him, offers to mankind the 
honest assistance of the Church in fostering that brotherhood of all men which 
corresponds to this destiny of theirs. Inspired by no earthly ambition, the 
Church seeks but a solitary goal: to carry forward the work of Christ under the 
lead of the befriending Spirit. And Christ entered this world to give witness to 
the truth, to rescue and not to sit in judgment, to serve and not to be 
served.(2)  </P>

<CENTER>
<B>INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT THE SITUATION OF MEN IN THE MODERN WORLD </B></CENTER>
										
										
										
										
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" size=3>
<P>4. To carry out such a task, the Church has always had the duty of 
scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the 
Gospel. Thus, in language intelligible to each generation, she can respond to 
the perennial questions which men ask about this present life and the life to 
come, and about the relationship of the one to the other. We must therefore 
recognize and understand the world in which we live, its explanations, its 
longings, and its often dramatic characteristics. Some of the main features of 
the modern world can be sketched as follows.</P>
<P>Today, the human race is involved in a new stage of history. Profound and 
rapid changes are spreading by degrees around the whole world. Triggered by the 
intelligence and creative energies of man, these changes recoil upon him, upon 
his decisions and desires, both individual and collective, and upon his manner 
of thinking and acting with respect to things and to people. Hence we can 
already speak of a true cultural and social transformation, one which has 
repercussions on man's religious life as well.</P>
<P>As happens in any crisis of growth, this transformation has brought serious 
difficulties in its wake. Thus while man extends his power in every direction, 
he does not always succeed in subjecting it to his own welfare. Striving to 
probe more profoundly into the deeper recesses of his own mind, he frequently 
appears more unsure of himself. Gradually and more precisely he lays bare the 
laws of society, only to be paralyzed by uncertainty about the direction to give 
it.</P>
<P>Never has the human race enjoyed such an abundance of wealth, resources and 
economic power, and yet a huge proportion of the worlds citizens are still 
tormented by hunger and poverty, while countless numbers suffer from total 
illiteracy. Never before has man had so keen an understanding of freedom, yet at 
the same time new forms of social and psychological slavery make their 
appearance. Although the world of today has a very vivid awareness of its unity 
and of how one man depends on another in needful solidarity, it is most 
grievously torn into opposing camps by conflicting forces. For political, 
social, economic, racial and ideological disputes still continue bitterly, and 
with them the peril of a war which would reduce everything to ashes. True, there 
is a growing exchange of ideas, but the very words by which key concepts are 
expressed take on quite different meanings in diverse ideological systems. 
Finally, man painstakingly searches for a better world, without a corresponding 
spiritual advancement.</P>
<P>Influenced by such a variety of complexities, many of our contemporaries are 
kept from accurately identifying permanent values and adjusting them properly to 
fresh discoveries. As a result, buffeted between hope and anxiety and pressing 
one another with questions about the present course of events, they are burdened 
down with uneasiness. This same course of events leads men to look for answers; 
indeed, it forces them to do so.</P>
<P>5. Today's spiritual agitation and the changing conditions of life are part 
of a broader and deeper revolution. As a result of the latter, intellectual 
formation is ever increasingly based on the mathematical and natural sciences 
and on those dealing with man himself, while in the practical order the 
technology which stems from these sciences takes on mounting importance.</P>
<P>This scientific spirit has a new kind of impact on the cultural sphere and on 
modes of thought. Technology is now transforming the face of the earth, and is 
already trying to master outer space. To a certain extent, the human intellect 
is also broadening its dominion over time: over the past by means of historical 
knowledge; over the future, by the art of projecting and by planning.</P>
<P>Advances in biology, psychology, and the social sciences not only bring men 
hope of improved self-knowledge; in conjunction with technical methods, they are 
helping men exert direct influence on the life of social groups.</P>
<P>At the same time, the human race is giving steadily-increasing thought to 
forecasting and regulating its own population growth. History itself speeds 
along on so rapid a course that an individual person can scarcely keep abreast 
of it. The destiny of the human community has become all of a piece, where once 
the various groups of men had a kind of private history of their own.</P>
<P>Thus, the human race has passed from a rather static concept of reality to a 
more dynamic, evolutionary one. In consequence there has arisen a new series of 
problems, a series as numerous as can be, calling for efforts of analysis and 
synthesis.</P>
<P>6. By this very circumstance, the traditional local communities such as 
families, clans, tribes, villages, various groups and associations stemming from 
social contacts, experience more thorough changes every day.</P>
<P>The industrial type of society is gradually being spread, leading some 
nations to economic affluence, and radically transforming ideas and social 
conditions established for centuries.</P>
<P>Likewise, the cult and pursuit of city living has grown, either because of a 
multiplication of cities and their inhabitants, or by a transplantation of city 
life to rural settings.</P>
<P>New and more efficient media of social communication are contributing to the 
knowledge of events; by setting off chain reactions they are giving the swiftest 
and widest possible circulation to styles of thought and feeling.</P>
<P>It is also noteworthy how many men are being induced to migrate on various 
counts, and are thereby changing their manner of life. Thus a man's ties with 
his fellows are constantly being multiplied, and at the same time 
&quot;socialization&quot; brings further ties, without however always promoting 
appropriate personal development and truly personal relationships.</P>
<P>This kind of evolution can be seen more clearly in those nations which 
already enjoy the conveniences of economic and technological progress, though it 
is also astir among peoples still striving for such progress and eager to secure 
for themselves the advantages of an industrialized and urbanized society. These 
peoples, especially those among them who are attached to older traditions, are 
simultaneously undergoing a movement toward more mature and personal exercise of 
liberty.</P>
<P>7. A change in attitudes and in human structures frequently calls accepted 
values into question, especially among young people, who have grown impatient on 
more than one occasion, and indeed become rebels in their distress. Aware of 
their own influence in the life of society, they want a part in it sooner. This 
frequently causes parents and educators to experience greater difficulties day 
by day in discharging their tasks. The institutions, laws and modes of thinking 
and feeling as handed down from previous generations do not always seem to be 
well adapted to the contemporary state of affairs; hence arises an upheaval in 
the manner and even the norms of behavior.</P>
<P>Finally, these new conditions have their impact on religion. On the one hand 
a more critical ability to distinguish religion from a magical view of the world 
and from the superstitions which still circulate purifies it and exacts day by 
day a more personal and explicit adherence to faith. As a result many persons 
are achieving a more vivid sense of God. On the other hand, growing numbers of 
people are abandoning religion in practice. Unlike former days, the denial of 
God or of religion, or the abandonment of them, are no longer unusual and 
individual occurrences. For today it is not rare for such things to be presented 
as requirements of scientific progress or of a certain new humanism. In numerous 
places these views are voiced not only in the teachings of philosophers, but on 
every side they influence literature, the arts, the interpretation of the 
humanities and of history and civil laws themselves. As a consequence, many 
people are shaken.</P>
<P>8. This development coming so rapidly and often in a disorderly fashion, 
combined with keener awareness itself of the inequalities in the world beget or 
intensify contradictions and imbalances.</P>
<P>Within the individual person there develops rather frequently an imbalance 
between an intellect which is modern in practical matters and a theoretical 
system of thought which can neither master the sum total of its ideas, nor 
arrange them adequately into a synthesis. Likewise an imbalance arises between a 
concern for practicality and efficiency, and the demands of moral conscience; 
also very often between the conditions of collective existence and the 
requisites of personal thought, and even of contemplation. At length there 
develops an imbalance between specialized human activity and a comprehensive 
view of reality.</P>
<P>As for the family, discord results from population, economic and social 
pressures, or from difficulties which arise between succeeding generations, or 
from new social relationships between men and women.</P>
<P>Differences crop up too between races and between various kinds of social 
orders; between wealthy nations and those which are less influential or are 
needy; finally, between international institutions born of the popular desire 
for peace, and the ambition to propagate one's own ideology, as well as 
collective greeds existing in nations or other groups.</P>
<P>What results is mutual distrust, enmities, conflicts and hardships. Of such 
is man at once the cause and the victim.</P>
<P>9. Meanwhile the conviction grows not only that humanity can and should 
increasingly consolidate its control over creation, but even more, that it 
devolves on humanity to establish a political, social and economic order which 
will growingly serve man and help individuals as well as groups to affirm and 
develop the dignity proper to them.</P>
<P>As a result many persons are quite aggressively demanding those benefits of 
which with vivid awareness they judge themselves to be deprived either through 
injustice or unequal distribution. Nations on the road to progress, like those 
recently made independent, desire to participate in the goods of modern 
civilization, not only in the political field but also economically, and to play 
their part freely on the world scene. Still they continually fall behind while 
very often their economic and other dependence on wealthier nations advances 
more rapidly.</P>
<P>People hounded by hunger call upon those better off. Where they have not yet 
won it, women claim for themselves an equity with men before the law and in 
fact. Laborers and farmers seek not only to provide for the necessities of life, 
but to develop the gifts of their personality by their labors and indeed to take 
part in regulating economic, social, political and cultural life. Now, for the 
first time in human history all people are convinced that the benefits of 
culture ought to be and actually can be extended to everyone.</P>
<P>Still, beneath all these demands lies a deeper and more widespread longing: 
persons and societies thirst for a full and free life worthy of man; one in 
which they can subject to their own welfare all that the modern world can offer 
them so abundantly. In addition, nations try harder every day to bring about a 
kind of universal community.</P>
<P>Since all these things are so, the modern world shows itself at once powerful 
and weak, capable of the noblest deeds or the foulest; before it lies the path 
to freedom or to slavery, to progress or retreat, to brotherhood or hatred. 
Moreover, man is becoming aware that it is his responsibility to guide aright 
the forces which he has unleashed and which can enslave him or minister to him. 
That is why he is putting questions to himself.</P>
<P>10. The truth is that the imbalances under which the modern world labors are 
linked with that more basic imbalance which is rooted in the heart of man. For 
in man himself many elements wrestle with one another. Thus, on the one hand, as 
a creature he experiences his limitations in a multitude of ways; on the other 
he feels himself to be boundless in his desires and summoned to a higher life. 
Pulled by manifold attractions he is constantly forced to choose among them and 
renounce some. Indeed, as a weak and sinful being, he often does what he would 
not, and fails to do what he would.(1) Hence he suffers from internal divisions, 
and from these flow so many and such great discords in society. No doubt many 
whose lives are infected with a practical materialism are blinded against any 
sharp insight into this kind of dramatic situation; or else, weighed down by 
unhappiness they are prevented from giving the matter any thought. Thinking they 
have found serenity in an interpretation of reality everywhere proposed these 
days, many look forward to a genuine and total emancipation of humanity wrought 
solely by human effort; they are convinced that the future rule of man over the 
earth will satisfy every desire of his heart. Nor are there lacking men who 
despair of any meaning to life and praise the boldness of those who think that 
human existence is devoid of any inherent significance and strive to confer a 
total meaning on it by their own ingenuity alone.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, in the face of the modern development of the world, the number 
constantly swells of the people who raise the most basic questions or recognize 
them with a new sharpness: what is man? What is this sense of sorrow, of evil, 
of death, which continues to exist despite so much progress? What purpose have 
these victories purchased at so high a cost? What can man offer to society, what 
can he expect from it? What follows this earthly life?</P>
<P>The Church firmly believes that Christ, who died and was raised up for 
all,(2) can through His Spirit offer man the light and the strength to measure 
up to his supreme destiny. Nor has any other name under the heaven been given to 
man by which it is fitting for him to be saved.(3) She likewise holds that in 
her most benign Lord and Master can be found the key, the focal point and the 
goal of man, as well as of all human history. The Church also maintains that 
beneath all changes there are many realities which do not change and which have 
their ultimate foundation in Christ, Who is the same yesterday and today, yes 
and forever.(4) Hence under the light of Christ, the image of the unseen God, 
the firstborn of every creature,(5) the council wishes to speak to all men in 
order to shed light on the mystery of man and to cooperate in finding the 
solution to the outstanding problems of our time. </P>

<P><B> PART I </B> </P>
<P><B>THE CHURCH AND MAN'S CALLING</B>  </P>
<P>11. The People of God believes that it is led by the Lord's Spirit, Who fills 
the earth. Motivated by this faith, it labors to decipher authentic signs of 
God's presence and purpose in the happenings, needs and desires in which this 
People has a part along with other men of our age. For faith throws a new light 
on everything, manifests God's design for man's total vocation, and thus directs 
the mind to solutions which are fully human.</P>
<P>This council, first of all, wishes to assess in this light those values which 
are most highly prized today and to relate them to their divine source. Insofar 
as they stem from endowments conferred by God on man, these values are 
exceedingly good. Yet they are often wrenched from their rightful function by 
the taint in man's heart, and hence stand in need of purification.</P>
<P>What does the Church think of man? What needs to be recommended for the 
upbuilding of contemporary society? What is the ultimate significance of human 
activity throughout the world? People are waiting for an answer to these 
questions. From the answers it will be increasingly clear that the People of God 
and the human race in whose midst it lives render service to each other. Thus 
the mission of the Church will show its religious, and by that very fact, its 
supremely human character.  </P>
<CENTER>
<B>CHAPTER I </B> 
										
										
										
										
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" size=3>
<P><B>THE DIGNITY OF THE HUMAN PERSON </B></P></CENTER>
<P>12. According to the almost unanimous opinion of believers and unbelievers 
alike, all things on earth should be related to man as their center and crown.</P>
<P>But what is man? About himself he has expressed, and continues to express, 
many divergent and even contradictory opinions. In these he often exalts himself 
as the absolute measure of all things or debases himself to the point of 
despair. The result is doubt and anxiety. The Church certainly understands these 
problems. Endowed with light from God, she can offer solutions to them, so that 
man's true situation can be portrayed and his defects explained, while at the 
same time his dignity and destiny are justly acknowledged.</P>
<P>For Sacred Scripture teaches that man was created &quot;to the image of God,&quot; is 
capable of knowing and loving his Creator, and was appointed by Him as master of 
all earthly creatures(1) that he might subdue them and use them to God's 
glory.(2) &quot;What is man that you should care for him? You have made him little 
less than the angels, and crowned him with glory and honor. You have given him 
rule over the works of your hands, putting all things under his feet&quot; (Ps. 
8:5-7).</P>
<P>But God did not create man as a solitary, for from the beginning &quot;male and 
female he created them&quot; (Gen. 1:27). Their companionship produces the primary 
form of interpersonal communion. For by his innermost nature man is a social 
being, and unless he relates himself to others he can neither live nor develop 
his potential.</P>
<P>Therefore, as we read elsewhere in Holy Scripture God saw &quot;all that he had 
made, and it was very good&quot; (Gen. 1:31).</P>
<P>13. Although he was made by God in a state of holiness, from the very onset 
of his history man abused his liberty, at the urging of the Evil One. Man set 
himself against God and sought to attain his goal apart from God. Although they 
knew God, they did not glorify Him as God, but their senseless minds were 
darkened and they served the creature rather than the Creator.(3) What divine 
revelation makes known to us agrees with experience. Examining his heart, man 
finds that he has inclinations toward evil too, and is engulfed by manifold ills 
which cannot come from his good Creator. Often refusing to acknowledge God as 
his beginning, man has disrupted also his proper relationship to his own 
ultimate goal as well as his whole relationship toward himself and others and 
all created things.</P>
<P>Therefore man is split within himself. As a result, all of human life, 
whether individual or collective, shows itself to be a dramatic struggle between 
good and evil, between light and darkness. Indeed, man finds that by himself he 
is incapable of battling the assaults of evil successfully, so that everyone 
feels as though he is bound by chains. But the Lord Himself came to free and 
strengthen man, renewing him inwardly and casting out that &quot;prince of this 
world&quot; (John 12:31) who held him in the bondage of sin.(4) For sin has 
diminished man, blocking his path to fulfillment.</P>
<P>The call to grandeur and the depths of misery, both of which are a part of 
human experience, find their ultimate and simultaneous explanation in the light 
of this revelation.</P>
<P>14. Though made of body and soul, man is one. Through his bodily composition 
he gathers to himself the elements of the material world; thus they reach their 
crown through him, and through him raise their voice in free praise of the 
Creator.(6) For this reason man is not allowed to despise his bodily life, 
rather he is obliged to regard his body as good and honorable since God has 
created it and will raise it up on the last day. Nevertheless, wounded by sin, 
man experiences rebellious stirrings in his body. But the very dignity of man 
postulates that man glorify God in his body and forbid it to serve the evil 
inclinations of his heart.</P>
<P>Now, man is not wrong when he regards himself as superior to bodily concerns, 
and as more than a speck of nature or a nameless constituent of the city of man. 
For by his interior qualities he outstrips the whole sum of mere things. He 
plunges into the depths of reality whenever he enters into his own heart; God, 
Who probes the heart,(7) awaits him there; there he discerns his proper destiny 
beneath the eyes of God. Thus, when he recognizes in himself a spiritual and 
immortal soul, he is not being mocked by a fantasy born only of physical or 
social influences, but is rather laying hold of the proper truth of the matter.</P>
<P>15. Man judges rightly that by his intellect he surpasses the material 
universe, for he shares in the light of the divine mind. By relentlessly 
employing his talents through the ages he has indeed made progress in the 
practical sciences and in technology and the liberal arts. In our times he has 
won superlative victories, especially in his probing of the material world and 
in subjecting it to himself. Still he has always searched for more penetrating 
truths, and finds them. For his intelligence is not confined to observable data 
alone, but can with genuine certitude attain to reality itself as knowable, 
though in consequence of sin that certitude is partly obscured and weakened.</P>
<P>The intellectual nature of the human person is perfected by wisdom and needs 
to be, for wisdom gently attracts the mind of man to a quest and a love for what 
is true and good. Steeped in wisdom. man passes through visible realities to 
those which are unseen.</P>
<P>Our era needs such wisdom more than bygone ages if the discoveries made by 
man are to be further humanized. For the future of the world stands in peril 
unless wiser men are forthcoming. It should also be pointed out that many 
nations, poorer in economic goods, are quite rich in wisdom and can offer 
noteworthy advantages to others.</P>
<P>It is, finally, through the gift of the Holy Spirit that man comes by faith 
to the contemplation and appreciation of the divine plan.(8)</P>
<P>16. In the depths of his conscience, man detects a law which he does not 
impose upon himself, but which holds him to obedience. Always summoning him to 
love good and avoid evil, the voice of conscience when necessary speaks to his 
heart: do this, shun that. For man has in his heart a law written by God; to 
obey it is the very dignity of man; according to it he will be judged.(9) 
Conscience is the most secret core and sanctuary of a man. There he is alone 
with God, Whose voice echoes in his depths.(10) In a wonderful manner conscience 
reveals that law which is fulfilled by love of God and neighbor.(11) In fidelity 
to conscience, Christians are joined with the rest of men in the search for 
truth, and for the genuine solution to the numerous problems which arise in the 
life of individuals from social relationships. Hence the more right conscience 
holds sway, the more persons and groups turn aside from blind choice and strive 
to be guided by the objective norms of morality. Conscience frequently errs from 
invincible ignorance without losing its dignity. The same cannot be said for a 
man who cares but little for truth and goodness, or for a conscience which by 
degrees grows practically sightless as a result of habitual sin.</P>
<P>17. Only in freedom can man direct himself toward goodness. Our 
contemporaries make much of this freedom and pursue it eagerly; and rightly to 
be sure. Often however they foster it perversely as a license for doing whatever 
pleases them, even if it is evil. For its part, authentic freedom is an 
exceptional sign of the divine image within man. For God has willed that man 
remain &quot;under the control of his own decisions,&quot;(12) so that he can seek his 
Creator spontaneously, and come freely to utter and blissful perfection through 
loyalty to Him. Hence man's dignity demands that he act according to a knowing 
and free choice that is personally motivated and prompted from within, not under 
blind internal impulse nor by mere external pressure. Man achieves such dignity 
when, emancipating himself from all captivity to passion, he pursues his goal in 
a spontaneous choice of what is good, and procures for himself through effective 
and skilful action, apt helps to that end. Since man's freedom has been damaged 
by sin, only by the aid of God's grace can he bring such a relationship with God 
into full flower. Before the judgement seat of God each man must render an 
account of his own life, whether he has done good or evil.(13)</P>
<P>18. It is in the face of death that the riddle a human existence grows most 
acute. Not only is man tormented by pain and by the advancing deterioration of 
his body, but even more so by a dread of perpetual extinction. He rightly 
follows the intuition of his heart when he abhors and repudiates the utter ruin 
and total disappearance of his own person. He rebels against death because he 
bears in himself an eternal seed which cannot be reduced to sheer matter. All 
the endeavors of technology, though useful in the extreme, cannot calm his 
anxiety; for prolongation of biological life is unable to satisfy that desire 
for higher life which is inescapably lodged in his breast.</P>
<P>Although the mystery of death utterly beggars the imagination, the Church has 
been taught by divine revelation and firmly teaches that man has been created by 
God for a blissful purpose beyond the reach of earthly misery. In addition, that 
bodily death from which man would have been immune had he not sinned(14) will be 
vanquished, according to the Christian faith, when man who was ruined by his own 
doing is restored to wholeness by an almighty and merciful Saviour. For God has 
called man and still calls him so that with his entire being he might be joined 
to Him in an endless sharing of a divine life beyond all corruption. Christ won 
this victory when He rose to life, for by His death He freed man from death. 
Hence to every thoughtful man a solidly established faith provides the answer to 
his anxiety about what the future holds for him. At the same time faith gives 
him the power to be united in Christ with his loved ones who have already been 
snatched away by death; faith arouses the hope that they have found true life 
with God.</P>
<P>19. The root reason for human dignity lies in man's call to communion with 
God. From the very circumstance of his origin man is already invited to converse 
with God. For man would not exist were he not created by Gods love and 
constantly preserved by it; and he cannot live fully according to truth unless 
he freely acknowledges that love and devotes himself to His Creator. Still, many 
of our contemporaries have never recognized this intimate and vital link with 
God, or have explicitly rejected it. Thus atheism must be accounted among the 
most serious problems of this age, and is deserving of closer examination.</P>
<P>The word atheism is applied to phenomena which are quite distinct from one 
another. For while God is expressly denied by some, others believe that man can 
assert absolutely nothing about Him. Still others use such a method to 
scrutinize the question of God as to make it seem devoid of meaning. Many, 
unduly transgressing the limits of the positive sciences, contend that 
everything can be explained by this kind of scientific reasoning alone, or by 
contrast, they altogether disallow that there is any absolute truth. Some laud 
man so extravagantly that their faith in God lapses into a kind of anemia, 
though they seem more inclined to affirm man than to deny God. Again some form 
for themselves such a fallacious idea of God that when they repudiate this 
figment they are by no means rejecting the God of the Gospel. Some never get to 
the point of raising questions about God, since they seem to experience no 
religious stirrings nor do they see why they should trouble themselves about 
religion. Moreover, atheism results not rarely from a violent protest against 
the evil in this world, or from the absolute character with which certain human 
values are unduly invested, and which thereby already accords them the stature 
of God. Modern civilization itself often complicates the approach to God not for 
any essential reason but because it is so heavily engrossed in earthly affairs.</P>
<P>Undeniably, those who willfully shut out God from their hearts and try to 
dodge religious questions are not following the dictates of their consciences, 
and hence are not free of blame; yet believers themselves frequently bear some 
responsibility for this situation. For, taken as a whole, atheism is not a 
spontaneous development but stems from a variety of causes, including a critical 
reaction against religious beliefs, and in some places against the Christian 
religion in particular. Hence believers can have more than a little to do with 
the birth of atheism. To the extent that they neglect their own training in the 
faith, or teach erroneous doctrine, or are deficient in their religious, moral 
or social life, they must be said to conceal rather than reveal the authentic 
face of God and religion.</P>
<P>20. Modern atheism often takes on a systematic expression which, in addition 
to other causes, stretches the desires for human independence to such a point 
that it poses difficulties against any kind of dependence on God. Those who 
profess atheism of this sort maintain that it gives man freedom to be an end 
unto himself, the sole artisan and creator of his own history. They claim that 
this freedom cannot be reconciled with the affirmation of a Lord Who is author 
and purpose of all things, or at least that this freedom makes such an 
affirmation altogether superfluous. Favoring this doctrine can be the sense of 
power which modern technical progress generates in man.</P>
<P>Not to be overlooked among the forms of modern atheism is that which 
anticipates the liberation of man especially through his economic and social 
emancipation. This form argues that by its nature religion thwarts this 
liberation by arousing man's hope for a deceptive future life, thereby diverting 
him from the constructing of the earthly city. Consequently when the proponents 
of this doctrine gain governmental power they vigorously fight against religion, 
and promote atheism by using, especially in the education of youth, those means 
of pressure which public power has at its disposal.</P>
<P>21. In her loyal devotion to God and men, the Church has already 
repudiated(16) and cannot cease repudiating, sorrowfully but as firmly as 
possible, those poisonous doctrines and actions which contradict reason and the 
common experience of humanity, and dethrone man from his native excellence.</P>
<P>Still, she strives to detect in the atheistic mind the hidden causes for the 
denial of God; conscious of how weighty are the questions which atheism raises, 
and motivated by love for all men, she believes these questions ought to be 
examined seriously and more profoundly.</P>
<P>The Church holds that the recognition of God is in no way hostile to man's 
dignity, since this dignity is rooted and perfected in God. For man was made an 
intelligent and free member of society by God Who created him, but even more 
important, he is called as a son to commune with God and share in His happiness. 
She further teaches that a hope related to the end of time does not diminish the 
importance of intervening duties but rather undergirds the acquittal of them 
with fresh incentives. By contrast, when a divine instruction and the hope of 
life eternal are wanting, man's dignity is most grievously lacerated, as current 
events often attest; riddles of life and death, of guilt and of grief go 
unsolved with the frequent result that men succumb to despair.</P>
<P>Meanwhile every man remains to himself an unsolved puzzle, however obscurely 
he may perceive it. For on certain occasions no one can entirely escape the kind 
of self-questioning mentioned earlier, especially when life's major events take 
place. To this questioning only God fully and most certainly provides an answer 
as He summons man to higher knowledge and humbler probing.</P>
<P>The remedy which must be applied to atheism, however, is to be sought in a 
proper presentation of the Church's teaching as well as in the integral life of 
the Church and her members. For it is the function of the Church, led by the 
Holy Spirit Who renews and purifies her ceaselessly,(17) to make God the Father 
and His Incarnate Son present and in a sense visible. This result is achieved 
chiefly by the witness of a living and mature faith, namely, one trained to see 
difficulties clearly and to master them. Many martyrs have given luminous 
witness to this faith and continue to do so. This faith needs to prove its 
fruitfulness by penetrating the believer's entire life, including its worldly 
dimensions, and by activating him toward justice and love, especially regarding 
the needy. What does the most reveal God's presence, however, is the brotherly 
charity of the faithful who are united in spirit as they work together for the 
faith of the Gospel(18) and who prove themselves a sign of unity.</P>
<P>While rejecting atheism, root and branch, the Church sincerely professes that 
all men, believers and unbelievers alike, ought to work for the rightful 
betterment of this world in which all alike live; such an ideal cannot be 
realized, however, apart from sincere and prudent dialogue. Hence the Church 
protests against the distinction which some state authorities make between 
believers and unbelievers, with prejudice to the fundamental rights of the human 
person. The Church calls for the active liberty of believers to build up in this 
world God's temple too. She courteously invites atheists to examine the Gospel 
of Christ with an open mind.</P>
<P>Above all the Church knows that her message is in harmony with the most 
secret desires of the human heart when she champions the dignity of the human 
vocation, restoring hope to those who have already despaired of anything higher 
than their present lot. Far from diminishing man, her message brings to his 
development light, life and freedom. Apart from this message nothing will avail 
to fill up the heart of man: &quot;Thou hast made us for Thyself,&quot; O Lord, &quot;and our 
hearts are restless till they rest in Thee.&quot;(19)</P>
<P>22. The truth is that only in the mystery of the incarnate Word does the 
mystery of man take on light. For Adam, the first man, was a figure of Him Who 
was to come,(20) namely Christ the Lord. Christ, the final Adam, by the 
revelation of the mystery of the Father and His love, fully reveals man to man 
himself and makes his supreme calling clear. It is not surprising, then, that in 
Him all the aforementioned truths find their root and attain their crown.</P>
<P>He Who is &quot;the image of the invisible God&quot; (Col. 1:15),(21) is Himself the 
perfect man. To the sons of Adam He restores the divine likeness which had been 
disfigured from the first sin onward. Since human nature as He assumed it was 
not annulled,(22) by that very fact it has been raised up to a divine dignity in 
our respect too. For by His incarnation the Son of God has united Himself in 
some fashion with every man. He worked with human hands, He thought with a human 
mind, acted by human choice(23) and loved with a human heart. Born of the Virgin 
Mary, He has truly been made one of us, like us in all things except sin.(24)</P>
<P>As an innocent lamb He merited for us life by the free shedding of His own 
blood. In Him God reconciled us(25) to Himself and among ourselves; from bondage 
to the devil and sin He delivered us, so that each one of us can say with the 
Apostle: The Son of God &quot;loved me and gave Himself up for me&quot; (Gal. 2:20). By 
suffering for us He not only provided us with an example for our imitation,(26) 
He blazed a trail, and if we follow it, life and death are made holy and take on 
a new meaning.</P>
<P>The Christian man, conformed to the likeness of that Son Who is the firstborn 
of many brothers,(27) received &quot;the first-fruits of the Spirit&quot; (Rom. 8:23) by 
which he becomes capable of discharging the new law of love.(28) Through this 
Spirit, who is &quot;the pledge of our inheritance&quot; (Eph. 1:14), the whole man is 
renewed from within, even to the achievement of &quot;the redemption of the body&quot; 
(Rom. 8:23): &quot;If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the death dwells in 
you, then he who raised Jesus Christ from the dead will also bring to life your 
mortal bodies because of his Spirit who dwells in you&quot; (Rom. 8:11).(29) Pressing 
upon the Christian to be sure, are the need and the duty to battle against evil 
through manifold tribulations and even to suffer death. But, linked with the 
paschal mystery and patterned on the dying Christ, he will hasten forward to 
resurrection in the strength which comes from hope.(30)</P>
<P>All this holds true not only for Christians, but for all men of good will in 
whose hearts grace works in an unseen way.(31) For, since Christ died for all 
men,(32) and since the ultimate vocation of man is in fact one, and divine, we 
ought to believe that the Holy Spirit in a manner known only to God offers to 
every man the possibility of being associated with this paschal mystery.</P>
<P>Such is the mystery of man, and it is a great one, as seen by believers in 
the light of Christian revelation. Through Christ and in Christ, the riddles of 
sorrow and death grow meaningful. Apart from His Gospel, they overwhelm us. 
Christ has risen, destroying death by His death; He has lavished life upon 
us(33) so that, as sons in the Son, we can cry out in the Spirit; Abba, 
Father(34)  </P>

<P><B>THE COMMUNITY OF MANKIND</B> </P></CENTER>
<P>23. One of the salient features of the modern world is the growing 
interdependence of men one on the other, a development promoted chiefly by 
modern technical advances. Nevertheless brotherly dialogue among men does not 
reach its perfection on the level of technical progress, but on the deeper level 
of interpersonal relationships. These demand a mutual respect for the full 
spiritual dignity of the person. Christian revelation contributes greatly to the 
promotion of this communion between persons, and at the same time leads us to a 
deeper understanding of the laws of social life which the Creator has written 
into man's moral and spiritual nature.</P>
<P>Since rather recent documents of the Church's teaching authority have dealt 
at considerable length with Christian doctrine about human society,(1) this 
council is merely going to call to mind some of the more basic truths, treating 
their foundations under the light of revelation. Then it will dwell more at 
length on certain of their implications having special significance for our day.</P>
<P>24. God, Who has fatherly concern for everyone, has willed that all men 
should constitute one family and treat one another in a spirit of brotherhood. 
For having been created in the image of God, Who &quot;from one man has created the 
whole human race and made them live all over the face of the earth&quot; (Acts 
17:26), all men are called to one and the same goal, namely God Himself.</P>
<P>For this reason, love for God and neighbor is the first and greatest 
commandment. Sacred Scripture, however, teaches us that the love of God cannot 
be separated from love of neighbor: &quot;If there is any other commandment, it is 
summed up in this saying: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.... Love 
therefore is the fulfillment of the Law&quot; (Rom. 13:9-10; cf. 1 John 4:20). To men 
growing daily more dependent on one another, and to a world becoming more 
unified every day, this truth proves to be of paramount importance.</P>
<P>Indeed, the Lord Jesus, when He prayed to the Father, &quot;that all may be one. . 
. as we are one&quot; (John 17:21-22) opened up vistas closed to human reason, for He 
implied a certain likeness between the union of the divine Persons, and the 
unity of God's sons in truth and charity. This likeness reveals that man, who is 
the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find 
himself except through a sincere gift of himself.(2)</P>
<P>25. Man's social nature makes it evident that the progress of the human 
person and the advance of society itself hinge on one another. For the 
beginning, the subject and the goal of all social institutions is and must be 
the human person which for its part and by its very nature stands completely in 
need of social life.(3) Since this social life is not something added on to man, 
through his dealings with others, through reciprocal duties, and through 
fraternal dialogue he develops all his gifts and is able to rise to his destiny.</P>
<P>Among those social ties which man needs for his development some, like the 
family and political community, relate with greater immediacy to his innermost 
nature; others originate rather from his free decision. In our era, for various 
reasons, reciprocal ties and mutual dependencies increase day by day and give 
rise to a variety of associations and organizations, both public and private. 
This development, which is called socialization, while certainly not without its 
dangers, brings with it many advantages with respect to consolidating and 
increasing the qualities of the human person, and safeguarding his rights.(4)</P>
<P>But if by this social life the human person is greatly aided in responding to 
his destiny, even in its religious dimensions, it cannot be denied that men are 
often diverted from doing good and spurred toward and by the social 
circumstances in which they live and are immersed from their birth. To be sure 
the disturbances which so frequently occur in the social order result in part 
from the natural tensions of economic, political and social forms. But at a 
deeper level they flow from man's pride and selfishness, which contaminate even 
the social sphere. When the structure of affairs is flawed by the consequences 
of sin, man, already born with a bent toward evil, finds there new inducements 
to sin, which cannot be overcome without strenuous efforts and the assistance of 
grace.</P>
<P>26. Every day human interdependence grows more tightly drawn and spreads by 
degrees over the whole world. As a result the common good, that is, the sum of 
those conditions of social life which allow social groups and their individual 
members relatively thorough and ready access to their own fulfillment, today 
takes on an increasingly universal complexion and consequently involves rights 
and duties with respect to the whole human race. Every social group must take 
account of the needs and legitimate aspirations of other groups, and even of the 
general welfare of the entire human family.(5)</P>
<P>At the same time, however, there is a growing awareness of the exalted 
dignity proper to the human person, since he stands above all things, and his 
rights and duties are universal and inviolable. Therefore, there must be made 
available to all men everything necessary for leading a life truly human, such 
as food, clothing, and shelter; the right to choose a state of life freely and 
to found a family, the right to education, to employment, to a good reputation, 
to respect, to appropriate information, to activity in accord with the upright 
norm of one's own conscience, to protection of privacy and rightful freedom 
even in matters religious.</P>
<P>Hence, the social order and its development must invariably work to the 
benefit of the human person if the disposition of affairs is to be subordinate 
to the personal realm and not contrariwise, as the Lord indicated when He said 
that the Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.(6)</P>
<P>This social order requires constant improvement. It must be founded on truth, 
built on justice and animated by love; in freedom it should grow every day 
toward a more humane balance.(7) An improvement in attitudes and abundant 
changes in society will have to take place if these objectives are to be gained.</P>
<P>God's Spirit, Who with a marvelous providence directs the unfolding of time 
and renews the face of the earth, is not absent from this development. The 
ferment of the Gospel too has aroused and continues to arouse in man's heart the 
irresistible requirements of his dignity.</P>
<P>27. Coming down to practical and particularly urgent consequences, this 
council lays stress on reverence for man; everyone must consider his every 
neighbor without exception as another self, taking into account first of all His 
life and the means necessary to living it with dignity,(8) so as not to imitate 
the rich man who had no concern for the poor man Lazarus.(9)</P>
<P>In our times a special obligation binds us to make ourselves the neighbor of 
every person without exception and of actively helping him when he comes across 
our path, whether he be an old person abandoned by all, a foreign laborer 
unjustly looked down upon, a refugee, a child born of an unlawful union and 
wrongly suffering for a sin he did not commit, or a hungry person who disturbs 
our conscience by recalling the voice of the Lord, &quot;As long as you did it for 
one of these the least of my brethren, you did it for me&quot; (Matt. 25:40).</P>
<P>Furthermore, whatever is opposed to life itself, such as any type of murder, 
genocide, abortion, euthanasia or wilful self-destruction, whatever violates the 
integrity of the human person, such as mutilation, torments inflicted on body or 
mind, attempts to coerce the will itself; whatever insults human dignity, such 
as subhuman living conditions, arbitrary imprisonment, deportation, slavery, 
prostitution, the selling of women and children; as well as disgraceful working 
conditions, where men are treated as mere tools for profit, rather than as free 
and responsible persons; all these things and others of their like are infamies 
indeed. They poison human society, but they do more harm to those who practice 
them than those who suffer from the injury. Moreover, they are supreme dishonor 
to the Creator.</P>
<P>28. Respect and love ought to be extended also to those who think or act 
differently than we do in social, political and even religious matters. In fact, 
the more deeply we come to understand their ways of thinking through such 
courtesy and love, the more easily will we be able to enter into dialogue with 
them.</P>
<P>This love and good will, to be sure, must in no way render us indifferent to 
truth and goodness. Indeed love itself impels the disciples of Christ to speak 
the saving truth to all men. But it is necessary to distinguish between error, 
which always merits repudiation, and the person in error, who never loses the 
dignity of being a person even when he is flawed by false or inadequate 
religious notions.(10) God alone is the judge and searcher of hearts, for that 
reason He forbids us to make judgments about the internal guilt of anyone.(11)</P>
<P>The teaching of Christ even requires that we forgive injuries,(12) and 
extends the law of love to include every enemy, according to the command of the 
New Law: &quot;You have heard that it was said: Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate 
thy enemy. But I say to you: love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, 
and pray for those who persecute and calumniate you&quot; (Matt. 5:43-44).</P>
<P>29. Since all men possess a rational soul and are created in God's likeness, 
since they have the same nature and origin, have been redeemed by Christ and 
enjoy the same divine calling and destiny, the basic equality of all must 
receive increasingly greater recognition.</P>
<P>True, all men are not alike from the point of view of varying physical power 
and the diversity of intellectual and moral resources. Nevertheless, with 
respect to the fundamental rights of the person, every type of discrimination, 
whether social or cultural, whether based on sex, race, color, social condition, 
language or religion, is to be overcome and eradicated as contrary to God's 
intent. For in truth it must still be regretted that fundamental personal rights 
are still not being universally honored. Such is the case of a woman who is 
denied the right to choose a husband freely, to embrace a state of life or to 
acquire an education or cultural benefits equal to those recognized for men.</P>
<P>Therefore, although rightful differences exist between men, the equal dignity 
of persons demands that a more humane and just condition of life be brought 
about. For excessive economic and social differences between the members of the 
one human family or population groups cause scandal, and militate against social 
justice, equity, the dignity of the human person, as well as social and 
international peace.</P>
<P>Human institutions, both private and public, must labor to minister to the 
dignity and purpose of man. At the same time let them put up a stubborn fight 
against any kind of slavery, whether social or political, and safeguard the 
basic rights of man under every political system. Indeed human institutions 
themselves must be accommodated by degrees to the highest of all realities, 
spiritual ones, even though meanwhile, a long enough time will be required 
before they arrive at the desired goal.</P>
<P>30. Profound and rapid changes make it more necessary that no one ignoring 
the trend of events or drugged by laziness, content himself with a merely 
individualistic morality. It grows increasingly true that the obligations of 
justice and love are fulfilled only if each person, contributing to the common 
good, according to his own abilities and the needs of others, also promotes and 
assists the public and private institutions dedicated to bettering the 
conditions of human life. Yet there are those who, while possessing grand and 
rather noble sentiments, nevertheless in reality live always as if they cared 
nothing for the needs of society. Many in various places even make light of 
social laws and precepts, and do not hesitate to resort to various frauds and 
deceptions in avoiding just taxes or other debts due to society. Others think 
little of certain norms of social life, for example those designed for the 
protection of health, or laws establishing speed limits; they do not even avert 
to the fact that by such indifference they imperil their own life and that of 
others.</P>
<P>Let everyone consider it his sacred obligation to esteem and observe social 
necessities as belonging to the primary duties of modern man. For the more 
unified the world becomes, the more plainly do the offices of men extend beyond 
particular groups and spread by degrees to the whole world. But this development 
cannot occur unless individual men and their associations cultivate in 
themselves the moral and social virtues, and promote them in society; thus, with 
the needed help of divine grace men who are truly new and artisans of a new 
humanity can be forthcoming</P>
<P>31. In order for individual men to discharge with greater exactness the 
obligations of their conscience toward themselves and the various group to which 
they belong, they must be carefully educated to a higher degree of culture 
through the use of the immense resources available today to the human race. 
Above all the education of youth from every social background has to be 
undertaken, so that there can be produced not only men and women of refined 
talents, but those great-souled persons who are so desperately required by our 
times.</P>
<P>Now a man can scarcely arrive at the needed sense of responsibility, unless 
his living conditions allow him to become conscious of his dignity, and to rise 
to his destiny by spending himself for God and for others. But human freedom is 
often crippled when a man encounters extreme poverty just as it withers when he 
indulges in too many of life's comforts and imprisons himself in a kind of 
splendid isolation. Freedom acquires new strength, by contrast, when a man 
consents to the unavoidable requirements of social life, takes on the manifold 
demands of human partnership, and commits himself to the service of the human 
community.</P>
<P>Hence, the will to play one's role in common endeavors should be everywhere 
encouraged. Praise is due to those national procedures which allow the largest 
possible number of citizens to participate in public affairs with genuine 
freedom. Account must be taken, to be sure, of the actual conditions of each 
people and the decisiveness required by public authority. If every citizen is to 
feel inclined to take part in the activities of the various groups which make up 
the social body, these must offer advantages which will attract members and 
dispose them to serve others. We can justly consider that the future of humanity 
lies in the hands of those who are strong enough to provide coming generations 
with reasons for living and hoping.</P>
<P>32. As God did not create man for life in isolation, but for the formation of 
social unity, so also &quot;it has pleased God to make men holy and save them not 
merely as individuals, without bond or link between them, but by making them 
into a single people, a people which acknowledges Him in truth and serves Him in 
holiness.&quot;(13) So from the beginning of salvation history He has chosen men not 
just as individuals but as members of a certain community. Revealing His mind to 
them, God called these chosen ones &quot;His people&quot; (Ex. 3:7-12), and even made a 
covenant with them on Sinai.(14)</P>
<P>This communitarian character is developed and consummated in the work of 
Jesus Christ. For the very Word made flesh willed to share in the human 
fellowship. He was present at the wedding of Cana, visited the house of 
Zacchaeus, ate with publicans and sinners. He revealed the love of the Father 
and the sublime vocation of man in terms of the most common of social realities 
and by making use of the speech and the imagery of plain everyday life. 
Willingly obeying' the laws of his country He sanctified those human ties, 
especially family ones, which are the source of social structures. He chose to 
lead the life proper to an artisan of His time and place.</P>
<P>In His preaching He clearly taught the sons of God to treat one another as 
brothers. In His prayers He pleaded that all His disciples might be &quot;one.&quot; 
Indeed as the redeemer of all, He offered Himself for all even to point of 
death. &quot;Greater love than this no one has, that one lay down his life for his 
friends&quot; (John 15:13). He commanded His Apostles to preach to all peoples the 
Gospel's message that the human race was to become the Family of God, in which 
the fullness of the Law would be love.</P>
<P>As the firstborn of many brethren and by the giving of His Spirit, He founded 
after His death and resurrection a new brotherly community composed of all those 
who receive Him in faith and in love. This He did through His Body, which is the 
Church. There everyone, as members one of the other, would render mutual service 
according to the different gifts bestowed on each.</P>
<P>This solidarity must be constantly increased until that day on which it will 
be brought to perfection. Then, saved by grace, men will offer flawless glory to 
God as a family beloved of God and of Christ their Brother.  </P>

<P><B>MAN'S ACTIVITY THROUGHOUT THE WORLD</B> </P></CENTER>
<P>33. Through his labors and his native endowments man has ceaselessly striven 
to better his life. Today, however, especially with the help of science and 
technology, he has extended his mastery over nearly the whole of nature and 
continues to do so. Thanks to increased opportunities for many kinds of social 
contact among nations, the human family is gradually recognizing that it comprises 
a single world community and is making itself so. Hence many benefits once 
looked for, especially from heavenly powers, man has now enterprisingly procured 
for himself.</P>
<P>In the face of these immense efforts which already preoccupy the whole human 
race, men agitate numerous questions among themselves. What is the meaning and 
value of this feverish activity? How should all these things be used? To the 
achievement of what goal are the strivings of individuals and societies heading? 
The Church guards the heritage of God's word and draws from it moral and 
religious principles without always having at hand the solution to particular 
problems. As such she desires to add the light of revealed truth to mankind's 
store of experience, so that the path which humanity has taken in recent times 
will not be a dark one.</P>
<P>34. Throughout the course of the centuries, men have labored to better the 
circumstances of their lives through a monumental amount of individual and 
collective effort. To believers, this point is settled: considered in itself, 
this human activity accords with God's will. For man, created to God's image, 
received a mandate to subject to himself the earth and all it contains, and to 
govern the world with justice and holiness;(1) a mandate to relate himself and 
the totality of things to Him Who was to be acknowledged as the Lord and Creator 
of all. Thus, by the subjection of all things to man, the name of God would be 
wonderful in all the earth.(2)</P>
<P>This mandate concerns the whole of everyday activity as well. For while 
providing the substance of life for themselves and their families, men and women 
are performing their activities in a way which appropriately benefits society. 
They can justly consider that by their labor they are unfolding the Creator's 
work, consulting the advantages of their brother men, and are contributing by 
their personal industry to the realization in history of the divine plan.(3)</P>
<P>Thus, far from thinking that works produced by man's own talent and energy 
are in opposition to God's power, and that the rational creature exists as a 
kind of rival to the Creator, Christians are convinced that the triumphs of the 
human race are a sign of God's grace and the flowering of His own mysterious 
design. For the greater man's power becomes, the farther his individual and 
community responsibility extends. Hence it is clear that men are not deterred by 
the Christian message from building up the world, or impelled to neglect the 
welfare of their fellows, but that they are rather more stringently bound to do 
these very things.(4)</P>
<P>35. Human activity, to be sure, takes its significance from its relationship 
to man. Just as it proceeds from man, so it is ordered toward man. For when a 
man works he not only alters things and society, he develops himself as well. He 
learns much, he cultivates his resources, he goes outside of himself and beyond 
himself. Rightly understood this kind of growth is of greater value than any 
external riches which can be garnered. A man is more precious for what he is 
than for what he has.(5) Similarly, all that men do to obtain greater justice, 
wider brotherhood, a more humane disposition of social relationships has greater 
worth than technical advances. For these advances can supply the material for 
human progress, but of themselves alone they can never actually bring it about.</P>
<P>Hence, the norm of human activity is this: that in accord with the divine 
plan and will, it harmonize with the genuine good of the human race, and that it 
allow men as individuals and as members of society to pursue their total 
vocation and fulfill it.</P>
<P>36. Now many of our contemporaries seem to fear that a closer bond between 
human activity and religion will work against the independence of men, of 
societies, or of the sciences.</P>
<P>If by the autonomy of earthly affairs we mean that created things and 
societies themselves enjoy their own laws and values which must be gradually 
deciphered, put to use, and regulated by men, then it is entirely right to 
demand that autonomy. Such is not merely required by modern man, but harmonizes 
also with the will of the Creator. For by the very circumstance of their having 
been created, all things are endowed with their own stability, truth, goodness, 
proper laws and order. Man must respect these as he isolates them by the 
appropriate methods of the individual sciences or arts. Therefore if methodical 
investigation within every branch of learning is carried out in a genuinely 
scientific manner and in accord with moral norms, it never truly conflicts with 
faith, for earthly matters and the concerns of faith derive from the same God. 
(6) Indeed whoever labors to penetrate the secrets of reality with a humble and 
steady mind, even though he is unaware of the fact, is nevertheless being led by 
the hand of God, who holds all things in existence, and gives them their 
identity. Consequently, we cannot but deplore certain habits of mind, which are 
sometimes found too among Christians, which do not sufficiently attend to the 
rightful independence of science and which, from the arguments and controversies 
they spark, lead many minds to conclude that faith and science are mutually 
opposed.(7)</P>
<P>But if the expression, the independence of temporal affairs, is taken to mean 
that created things do not depend on God, and that man can use them without any 
reference to their Creator, anyone who acknowledges God will see how false such 
a meaning is. For without the Creator the creature would disappear. For their 
part, however, all believers of whatever religion always hear His revealing 
voice in the discourse of creatures. When God is forgotten, however, the 
creature itself grows unintelligible.</P>
<P>37. Sacred Scripture teaches the human family what the experience of the ages 
confirms: that while human progress is a great advantage to man, it brings with 
it a strong temptation. For when the order of values is jumbled and bad is mixed 
with the good, individuals and groups pay heed solely to their own interests, 
and not to those of others. Thus it happens that the world ceases to be a place 
of true brotherhood. In our own day, the magnified power of humanity threatens 
to destroy the race itself.</P>
<P>For a monumental struggle against the powers of darkness pervades the whole 
history of man. The battle was joined from the very origins of the world and 
will continue until the last day, as the Lord has attested.(8) Caught in this 
conflict, man is obliged to wrestle constantly if he is to cling to what is 
good, nor can he achieve his own integrity without great efforts and the help of 
God's grace.</P>
<P>That is why Christ's Church, trusting in the design of the Creator, 
acknowledges that human progress can serve man's true happiness, yet she cannot 
help echoing the Apostle's warning: &quot;Be not conformed to this world&quot; (Rom. 
12:2). Here by the world is meant that spirit of vanity and malice which 
transforms into an instrument of sin those human energies intended for the 
service of God and man.</P>
<P>Hence if anyone wants to know how this unhappy situation can be overcome, 
Christians will tell him that all human activity, constantly imperiled by man's 
pride and deranged self-love, must be purified and perfected by the power of 
Christ's cross and resurrection. For redeemed by Christ and made a new creature 
in the Holy Spirit, man is able to love the things themselves created by God, 
and ought to do so. He can receive them from God and respect and reverence them 
as flowing constantly from the hand of God. Grateful to his Benefactor for these 
creatures, using and enjoying them in detachment and liberty of spirit, man is 
led forward into a true possession of them, as having nothing, yet possessing 
all things.(9) &quot;All are yours, and you are Christ's, and Christ is God's&quot; (1 
Cor. 3:22-23).</P>
<P>38. For God's Word, through Whom all things were made, was Himself made flesh 
and dwelt on the earth of men.(10) Thus He entered the world's history as a 
perfect man, taking that history up into Himself and summarizing it.(11) He 
Himself revealed to us that &quot;God is love&quot; (1 John 4:8) and at the same time 
taught us that the new command of love was the basic law of human perfection and 
hence of the worlds transformation.</P>
<P>To those, therefore, who believe in divine love, He gives assurance that the 
way of love lies open to men and that the effort to establish a universal 
brotherhood is not a hopeless one. He cautions them at the same time that this 
charity is not something to be reserved for important matters, but must be 
pursued chiefly in the ordinary circumstances of life. Undergoing death itself 
for all of us sinners,(12) He taught us by example that we too must shoulder 
that cross which the world and the flesh inflict upon those who search after 
peace and justice. Appointed Lord by His resurrection and given plenary power in 
heaven and on earth,(13) Christ is now at work in the hearts of men through the 
energy of His Holy Spirit, arousing not only a desire for the age to come, but 
by that very fact animating, purifying and strengthening those noble longings 
too by which the human family makes its life more human and strives to render 
the whole earth submissive to this goal.</P>
<P>Now, the gifts of the Spirit are diverse: while He calls some to give clear 
witness to the desire for a heavenly home and to keep that desire green among 
the human family, He summons others to dedicate themselves to the earthly 
service of men and to make ready the material of the celestial realm by this 
ministry of theirs. Yet He frees all of them so that by putting aside love of 
self and bringing all earthly resources into the service of human life they can 
devote themselves to that future when humanity itself will become an offering 
accepted by God.(14)</P>
<P>The Lord left behind a pledge of this hope and strength for life's journey in 
that sacrament of faith where natural elements refined by man are gloriously 
changed into His Body and Blood, providing a meal of brotherly solidarity and a 
foretaste of the heavenly banquet.</P>
<P>39. We do not know the time for the consummation of the earth and of 
humanity,(15) nor do we know how all things will be transformed. As deformed by 
sin, the shape of this world will pass away;(16) but we are taught that God is 
preparing a new dwelling place and a new earth where justice will abide,(17) and 
whose blessedness will answer and surpass all the longings for peace which 
spring up in the human heart.(18) Then, with death overcome, the sons of God 
will be raised up in Christ, and what was sown in weakness and corruption will 
be invested with incorruptibility.(19) Enduring with charity and its fruits,(20) 
all that creation(21) which God made on man's account will be unchained from the 
bondage of vanity.</P>
<P>Therefore, while we are warned that it profits a man nothing if he gain the 
whole world and lose himself,(22) the expectation of a new earth must not weaken 
but rather stimulate our concern for cultivating this one. For here grows the 
body of a new human family, a body which even now is able to give some kind of 
foreshadowing of the new age.</P>
<P>Hence, while earthly progress must be carefully distinguished from the growth 
of Christ's kingdom, to the extent that the former can contribute to the better 
ordering of human society, it is of vital concern to the Kingdom of God.(23)</P>
<P>For after we have obeyed the Lord, and in His Spirit nurtured on earth the 
values of human dignity, brotherhood and freedom, and indeed all the good fruits 
of our nature and enterprise, we will find them again, but freed of stain, 
burnished and transfigured, when Christ hands over to the Father: &quot;a kingdom 
eternal and universal, a kingdom of truth and life, of holiness and grace, of 
justice, love and peace.&quot;(24) On this earth that Kingdom is already present in 
mystery. When the Lord returns it will be brought into full flower.  </P>

<B>CHAPTER IV</B>  <BR><B>THE ROLE OF THE CHURCH IN THE MODERN WORLD</B>
</CENTER>
</FONT>
<P>40. Everything we have said about the dignity of the human person, and about 
the human community and the profound meaning of human activity, lays the 
foundation for the relationship between the Church and the world, and provides 
the basis for dialogue between them.(1) In this chapter, presupposing everything 
which has already been said by this council concerning the mystery of the 
Church, we must now consider this same Church inasmuch as she exists in the 
world, living and acting with it.</P>
<P>Coming forth from the eternal Father's love,(2) founded in time by Christ the 
Redeemer and made one in the Holy Spirit,(3) the Church has a saving and an 
eschatological purpose which can be fully attained only in the future world. But 
she is already present in this world, and is composed of men, that is, of 
members of the earthly city who have a call to form the family of God's children 
during the present history of the human race, and to keep increasing it until 
the Lord returns. United on behalf of heavenly values and enriched by them, this 
family has been &quot;constituted and structured as a society in this world&quot;(4) by 
Christ, and is equipped &quot;by appropriate means for visible and social union.&quot;(5) 
Thus the Church, at once &quot;a visible association and a spiritual community,&quot;(6) 
goes forward together with humanity and experiences the same earthly lot which 
the world does. She serves as a leaven and as a kind of soul for human 
society(7) as it is to be renewed in Christ and transformed into God's family.</P>
<P>That the earthly and the heavenly city penetrate each other is a fact 
accessible to faith alone; it remains a mystery of human history, which sin will 
keep in great disarray until the splendor of God's sons, is fully revealed. 
Pursuing the saving purpose which is proper to her, the Church does not only 
communicate divine life to men but in some way casts the reflected light of that 
life over the entire earth, most of all by its healing and elevating impact on 
the dignity of the person, by the way in which it strengthens the seams of human 
society and imbues the everyday activity of men with a deeper meaning and 
importance. Thus through her individual matters and her whole community, the 
Church believes she can contribute greatly toward making the family of man and 
its history more human.</P>
<P>In addition, the Catholic Church gladly holds in high esteem the things which 
other Christian Churches and ecclesial communities have done or are doing 
cooperatively by way of achieving the same goal. At the same time, she is 
convinced that she can be abundantly and variously helped by the world in the 
matter of preparing the ground for the Gospel. This help she gains from the 
talents and industry of individuals and from human society as a whole. The 
council now sets forth certain general principles for the proper fostering of 
this mutual exchange and assistance in concerns which are in some way common to 
the world and the Church.</P>
<P>41. Modern man is on the road to a more thorough development of his own 
personality, and to a growing discovery and vindication of his own rights. Since 
it has been entrusted to the Church to reveal the mystery of God, Who is the 
ultimate goal of man, she opens up to man at the same time the meaning of his 
own existence, that is, the innermost truth about himself. The Church truly 
knows that only God, Whom she serves, meets the deepest longings of the human 
heart, which is never fully satisfied by what this world has to offer.</P>
<P>She also knows that man is constantly worked upon by God's spirit, and hence 
can never be altogether indifferent to the problems of religion. The experience 
of past ages proves this, as do numerous indications in our own times. For man 
will always yearn to know, at least in an obscure way, what is the meaning of 
his life, of his activity, of his death. The very presence of the Church recalls 
these problems to his mind. But only God, Who created man to His own image and 
ransomed him from sin, provides the most adequate answer to the questions, and 
this He does through what He has revealed in Christ His Son, Who became man. 
Whoever follows after Christ, the perfect man, becomes himself more of a man. 
For by His incarnation the Father's Word assumed, and sanctified through His 
cross and resurrection, the whole of man, body and soul, and through that 
totality the whole of nature created by God for man's use.</P>
<P>Thanks to this belief, the Church can anchor the dignity of human nature 
against all tides of opinion, for example those which undervalue the human body 
or idolize it. By no human law can the personal dignity and liberty of man be so 
aptly safeguarded as by the Gospel of Christ which has been entrusted to the 
Church. For this Gospel announces and proclaims the freedom of the sons of God, 
and repudiates all the bondage which ultimately results from sin.(8) (cf. Rom. 
8:14-17); it has a sacred reverence for the dignity of conscience and its 
freedom of choice, constantly advises that all human talents be employed in 
God's service and men's, and, finally, commends all to the charity of all (cf. 
Matt. 22:39).(9)</P>
<P>This agrees with the basic law of the Christian dispensation. For though the 
same God is Savior and Creator, Lord of human history as well as of salvation 
history, in the divine arrangement itself, the rightful autonomy of the 
creature, and particularly of man is not withdrawn, but is rather re-established 
in its own dignity and strengthened in it.</P>
<P>The Church, therefore, by virtue of the Gospel committed to her, proclaims 
the rights of man; she acknowledges and greatly esteems the dynamic movements of 
today by which these rights are everywhere fostered. Yet these movements must be 
penetrated by the spirit of the Gospel and protected against any kind of false 
autonomy. For we are tempted to think that our personal rights are fully ensured 
only when we are exempt from every requirement of divine law. But this way lies 
not the maintenance of the dignity of the human person, but its annihilation.</P>
<P>42. The union of the human family is greatly fortified and fulfilled by the 
unity, founded on Christ,(10) of the family of God's sons.</P>
<P>Christ, to be sure, gave His Church no proper mission in the political, 
economic or social order. The purpose which He set before her is a religious 
one.(11) But out of this religious mission itself come a function, a light and 
an energy which can serve to structure and consolidate the human community 
according to the divine law. As a matter of fact, when circumstances of time and 
place produce the need, she can and indeed should initiate activities on behalf 
of all men, especially those designed for the needy, such as the works of mercy 
and similar undertakings.</P>
<P>The Church recognizes that worthy elements are found in today's social 
movements, especially an evolution toward unity, a process of wholesome 
socialization and of association in civic and economic realms. The promotion of 
unity belongs to the innermost nature of the Church, for she is, &quot;thanks to her 
relationship with Christ, a sacramental sign and an instrument of intimate union 
with God, and of the unity of the whole human race.&quot;(12) Thus she shows the 
world that an authentic union, social and external, results from a union of 
minds and hearts, namely from that faith and charity by which her own unity is 
unbreakably rooted in the Holy Spirit. For the force which the Church can inject 
into the modern society of man consists in that faith and charity put into vital 
practice, not in any external dominion exercised by merely human means.</P>
<P>Moreover, since in virtue of her mission and nature she is bound to no 
particular form of human culture, nor to any political, economic or social 
system, the Church by her very universality can be a very close bond between 
diverse human communities and nations, provided these trust her and truly 
acknowledge her right to true freedom in fulfilling her mission. For this 
reason, the Church admonishes her own sons, but also humanity as a whole, to 
overcome all strife between nations and race in this family spirit of God's 
children, an in the same way, to give internal strength to human associations 
which are just.</P>
<P>With great respect, therefore, this council regards all the true, good and 
just elements inherent in the very wide variety of institutions which the human 
race has established for itself and constantly continues to establish. The 
council affirms, moreover, that the Church is willing to assist and promote all 
these institutions to the extent that such a service depends on her and can be 
associated with her mission. She has no fiercer desire than that in pursuit of 
the welfare of all she may be able to develop herself freely under any kind of 
government which grants recognition to the basic rights of person and family, to 
the demands of the common good and to the free exercise of her own mission.</P>
<P>43. This council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to 
discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit. 
They are mistaken who, knowing that we have here no abiding city but seek one 
which is to come,(13) think that they may therefore shirk their earthly 
responsibilities. For they are forgetting that by the faith itself they are more 
obliged than ever to measure up to these duties, each according to his proper 
vocation.(14) Nor, on the contrary, are they any less wide of the mark who think 
that religion consists in acts of worship alone and in the discharge of certain 
moral obligations, and who imagine they can plunge themselves into earthly 
affairs in such a way as to imply that these are altogether divorced from the 
religious life. This split between the faith which many profess and their daily 
lives deserves to be counted among the more serious errors of our age. Long 
since, the Prophets of the Old Testament fought vehemently against this 
scandal(15) and even more so did Jesus Christ Himself in the New Testament 
threaten it with grave punishments.(16) Therefore, let there be no false 
opposition between professional and social activities on the one part, and 
religious life on the other. The Christian who neglects his temporal duties, 
neglects his duties toward his neighbor and even God, and jeopardizes his 
eternal salvation. Christians should rather rejoice that, following the example 
of Christ Who worked as an artisan, they are free to give proper exercise to all 
their earthly activities and to their humane, domestic, professional, social and 
technical enterprises by gathering them into one vital synthesis with religious 
values, under whose supreme direction all things are harmonized unto God's 
glory.</P>
<P>Secular duties and activities belong properly although not exclusively to 
laymen. Therefore acting as citizens in the world, whether individually or 
socially, they will keep the laws proper to each discipline, and labor to equip 
themselves with a genuine expertise in their various fields. They will gladly 
work with men seeking the same goals. Acknowledging the demands of faith and 
endowed with its force, they will unhesitatingly devise new enterprises, where 
they are appropriate, and put them into action. Laymen should also know that it 
is generally the function of their well-formed Christian conscience to see that 
the divine law is inscribed in the life of the earthly city; from priests they 
may look for spiritual light and nourishment. Let the layman not imagine that 
his pastors are always such experts, that to every problem which arises, however 
complicated, they can readily give him a concrete solution, or even that such is 
their mission. Rather, enlightened by Christian wisdom and giving close 
attention to the teaching authority of the Church,(17) let the layman take on 
his own distinctive role.</P>
<P>Often enough the Christian view of things will itself suggest some specific 
solution in certain circumstances. Yet it happens rather frequently, and 
legitimately so, that with equal sincerity some of the faithful will disagree 
with others on a given matter. Even against the intentions of their proponents, 
however, solutions proposed on one side or another may be easily confused by 
many people with the Gospel message. Hence it is necessary for people to 
remember that no one is allowed in the aforementioned situations to appropriate 
the Church's authority for his opinion. They should always try to enlighten one 
another through honest discussion, preserving mutual charity and caring above 
all for the common good.</P>
<P>Since they have an active role to play in the whole life of the Church, 
laymen are not only bound to penetrate the world with a Christian spirit, but 
are also called to be witnesses to Christ in all things in the midst of human 
society.</P>
<P>Bishops, to whom is assigned the task of ruling the Church of God, should, 
together with their priests, so preach the news of Christ that all the earthly 
activities of the faithful will be bathed in the light of the Gospel. All 
pastors should remember too that by their daily conduct and concern(18) they are 
revealing the face of the Church to the world, and men will judge the power and 
truth of the Christian message thereby. By their lives and speech, in union with 
Religious and their faithful, may they demonstrate that even now the Church by 
her presence alone and by all the gifts which she contains, is an unspent 
fountain of those virtues which the modern world needs the most.</P>
<P>By unremitting study they should fit themselves to do their part in 
establishing dialogue with the world and with men of all shades of opinion. 
Above all let them take to heart the words which this council has spoken: &quot;Since 
humanity today increasingly moves toward civil, economic and social unity, it is 
more than ever necessary that priests, with joint concern and energy, and under 
the guidance of the bishops and the supreme pontiff, erase every cause of 
division, so that the whole human race may be led to the unity of God's 
family.&quot;(19)</P>
<P>Although by the power of the Holy Spirit the Church will remain the faithful 
spouse of her Lord and will never cease to be the sign of salvation on earth, 
still she is very well aware that among her members,(20) both clerical and lay, 
some have been unfaithful to the Spirit of God during the course of many 
centuries; in the present age, too, it does not escape the Church how great a 
distance lies between the message she offers and the human failings of those to 
whom the Gospel is entrusted. Whatever be the judgement of history on these 
defects, we ought to be conscious of them, and struggle against them 
energetically, lest they inflict harm on spread of the Gospel. The Church also 
realizes that in working out her relationship with the world she always has 
great need of the ripening which comes with the experience of the centuries. Led 
by the Holy Spirit, Mother Church unceasingly exhorts her sons &quot;to purify and 
renew themselves so that the sign of Christ can shine more brightly on the face 
of the Church.&quot;(21)</P>
<P>44. Just as it is in the world's interest to acknowledge the Church as an 
historical reality, and to recognize her good influence, so the Church herself 
knows how richly she has profited by the history and development of humanity.</P>
<P>The experience of past ages, the progress of the sciences, and the treasures 
hidden in the various forms of human culture, by all of which the nature of man 
himself is more clearly revealed and new roads to truth are opened, these profit 
the Church, too. For, from the beginning of her history she has learned to 
express the message of Christ with the help of the ideas and terminology of 
various philosophers, and and has tried to clarify it with their wisdom, too. 
Her purpose has been to adapt the Gospel to the grasp of all as well as to the 
needs of the learned, insofar as such was appropriate. Indeed this accommodated 
preaching of the revealed word ought to remain the law of all evangelization. 
For thus the ability to express Christ's message in its own way is developed in 
each nation, and at the same time there is fostered a living exchange between 
the Church and the diverse cultures of people.(22) To promote such exchange, 
especially in our days, the Church requires the special help of those who live 
in the world, are versed in different institutions and specialties, and grasp 
their innermost significance in the eyes of both believers and unbelievers. With 
the help of the Holy Spirit, it is the task of the entire People of God, 
especially pastors and theologians, to hear, distinguish and interpret the many 
voices of our age, and to judge them in the light of the divine word, so that 
revealed truth can always be more deeply penetrated, better understood and set 
forth to greater advantage.</P>
<P>Since the Church has a visible and social structure as a sign of her unity in 
Christ, she can and ought to be enriched by the development of human social 
life, not that there is any lack in the constitution given her by Christ, but 
that she can understand it more penetratingly, express it better, and adjust it 
more successfully to our times. Moreover, she gratefully understands that in her 
community life no less than in her individual sons, she receives a variety of 
helps from men of every rank and condition, for whoever promotes the human 
community at the family level, culturally, in its economic, social and political 
dimensions, both nationally and internationally, such a one, according to God's 
design, is contributing greatly to the Church as well, to the extent that she 
depends on things outside herself. Indeed, the Church admits that she has 
greatly profited and still profits from the antagonism of those who oppose or 
who persecute her.(23)</P>
<P>45. While helping the world and receiving many benefits from it, the Church 
has a single intention: that God's kingdom may come, and that the salvation of 
the whole human race may come to pass. For every benefit which the People of God 
during its earthly pilgrimage can offer to the human family stems from the fact 
that the Church is &quot;the universal sacrament of salvation&quot;,(24) simultaneously 
manifesting and exercising the mystery of God's love.</P>
<P>For God's Word, by whom all things were made, was Himself made flesh so that 
as perfect man He might save all men and sum up all things in Himself. The Lord 
is the goal of human history, the focal point of the longings of history and of 
civilization, the center of the human race, the joy of every heart and the 
answer to all its yearnings.(25) He it is Whom the Father raised from the dead, 
lifted on high and stationed at His right hand, making Him judge of the living 
and the dead. Enlivened and united in His Spirit, we journey toward the 
consummation of human history, one which fully accords with the counsel of God's 
love: &quot;To reestablish all things in Christ, both those in the heavens and those 
on the earth&quot; (Eph. 11:10).</P>
<P>The Lord Himself speaks: &quot;Behold I come quickly! And my reward is with me, to 
render to each one according to his works. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the 
first and the last, the beginning and the end (Rev. 22:12-13).  </P>

<P><B>PART II  </B></P>
<P><B>SOME PROBLEMS OF SPECIAL URGENCY </B></P>
<P>46. This council has set forth the dignity of the human person, and the work 
which men have been destined to undertake throughout the world both as 
individuals and as members of society. There are a number of particularly urgent 
needs characterizing the present age, needs which go to the roots of the human 
race. To a consideration of these in the light of the Gospel and of human 
experience, the council would now direct the attention of all.</P>
<P>Of the many subjects arousing universal concern today, it may be helpful to 
concentrate on these: marriage and the family, human progress, life in its 
economic, social and political dimensions, the bonds between the family of 
nations, and peace. On each of these may there shine the radiant ideals 
proclaimed by Christ. By these ideals may Christians be led, and all mankind 
enlightened, as they search for answers to questions of such complexity.  </P>
<CENTER>
<B>CHAPTER I</B>  
										
										
										
										
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" size=3>
<P><B>FOSTERING THE NOBILITY OF MARRIAGE AND THE FAMILY</B> </P></CENTER>
<P>47. The well-being of the individual person and of human and Christian 
society is intimately linked with the healthy condition of that community 
produced by marriage and family. Hence Christians and all men who hold this 
community in high esteem sincerely rejoice in the various ways by which men 
today find help in fostering this community of love and perfecting its life, and 
by which parents are assisted in their lofty calling. Those who rejoice in such 
aids look for additional benefits from them and labor to bring them about.</P>
<P>Yet the excellence of this institution is not everywhere reflected with equal 
brilliance, since polygamy, the plague of divorce, so-called free love and other 
disfigurements have an obscuring effect. In addition, married love is too often 
profaned by excessive self-love, the worship of pleasure and illicit practices 
against human generation. Moreover, serious disturbances are caused in families 
by modern economic conditions, by influences at once social and psychological, 
and by the demands of civil society. Finally, in certain parts of the world 
problems resulting from population growth are generating concern.</P>
<P>All these situations have produced anxiety of consciences. Yet, the power and 
strength of the institution of marriage and family can also be seen in the fact 
that time and again, despite the difficulties produced, the profound changes in 
modern society reveal the true character of this institution in one way or 
another.</P>
<P>Therefore, by presenting certain key points of Church doctrine in a clearer 
light, this sacred synod wishes to offer guidance and support to those 
Christians and other men who are trying to preserve the holiness and to foster 
the natural dignity of the married state and its superlative value.</P>
<P>48. The intimate partnership of married life and love has been established by 
the Creator and qualified by His laws, and is rooted in the conjugal covenant of 
irrevocable personal consent. Hence by that human act whereby spouses mutually 
bestow and accept each other a relationship arises which by divine will and in 
the eyes of society too is a lasting one. For the good of the spouses and their 
off-springs as well as of society, the existence of the sacred bond no longer 
depends on human decisions alone. For, God Himself is the author of matrimony, 
endowed as it is with various benefits and purposes.(1) All of these have a very 
decisive bearing on the continuation of the human race, on the personal 
development and eternal destiny of the individual members of a family, and on 
the dignity, stability, peace and prosperity of the family itself and of human 
society as a whole. By their very nature, the institution of matrimony itself 
and conjugal love are ordained for the procreation and education of children, 
and find in them their ultimate crown. Thus a man and a woman, who by their 
compact of conjugal love &quot;are no longer two, but one flesh&quot; (Matt. 19:ff), 
render mutual help and service to each other through an intimate union of their 
persons and of their actions. Through this union they experience the meaning of 
their oneness and attain to it with growing perfection day by day. As a mutual 
gift of two persons, this intimate union and the good of the children impose 
total fidelity on the spouses and argue for an unbreakable oneness between 
them.(2)</P>
<P>Christ the Lord abundantly blessed this many-faceted love, welling up as it 
does from the fountain of divine love and structured as it is on the model of 
His union with His Church. For as God of old made Himself present(3) to His 
people through a covenant of love and fidelity, so now the Savior of men and the 
Spouse(4) of the Church comes into the lives of married Christians through the 
sacrament of matrimony. He abides with them thereafter so that just as He loved 
the Church and handed Himself over on her behalf,(6) the spouses may love each 
other with perpetual fidelity through mutual self-bestowal.</P>
<P>Authentic married love is caught up into divine love and is governed and 
enriched by Christ's redeeming power and the saving activity of the Church, so 
that this love may lead the spouses to God with powerful effect and may aid and 
strengthen them in sublime office of being a father or a mother.(6) For this 
reason Christian spouses have a special sacrament by which they are fortified 
and receive a kind of consecration in the duties and dignity of their state.(7) 
By virtue of this sacrament, as spouses fulfil their conjugal and family 
obligation, they are penetrated with the spirit of Christ, which suffuses their 
whole lives with faith, hope and charity. Thus they increasingly advance the 
perfection of their own personalities, as well as their mutual sanctification, 
and hence contribute jointly to the glory of God.</P>
<P>As a result, with their parents leading the way by example and family prayer, 
children and indeed everyone gathered around the family hearth will find a 
readier path to human maturity, salvation and holiness. Graced with the dignity 
and office of fatherhood and motherhood, parents will energetically acquit 
themselves of a duty which devolves primarily on them, namely education and 
especially religious education.</P>
<P>As living members of the family, children contribute in their own way to 
making their parents holy. For they will respond to the kindness of their 
parents with sentiments of gratitude, with love and trust. They will stand by 
them as children should when hardships overtake their parents and old age brings 
its loneliness. Widowhood, accepted bravely as a continuation of the marriage 
vocation, should be esteemed by all.(8) Families too will share their spiritual 
riches generously with other families. Thus the Christian family, which springs 
from marriage as a reflection of the loving covenant uniting Christ with the 
Church,(9) and as a participation in that covenant, will manifest to all men 
Christ's living presence in the world, and the genuine nature of the Church. 
This the family will do by the mutual love of the spouses, by their generous 
fruitfulness, their solidarity and faithfulness, and by the loving way in which 
all members of the family assist one another.</P>
<P>49. The biblical Word of God several times urges the betrothed and the 
married to nourish and develop their wedlock by pure conjugal love and undivided 
affection.(10) Many men of our own age also highly regard true love between 
husband and wife as it manifests itself in a variety of ways depending on the 
worthy customs of various peoples and times.</P>
<P>This love is an eminently human one since it is directed from one person to 
another through an affection of the will; it involves the good of the whole 
person, and therefore can enrich the expressions of body and mind with a unique 
dignity, ennobling these expressions as special ingredients and signs of the 
friendship distinctive of marriage. This love God has judged worthy of special 
gifts, healing, perfecting and exalting gifts of grace and of charity. Such 
love, merging the human with the divine, leads the spouses to a free and mutual 
gift of themselves, a gift providing itself by gentle affection and by deed, 
such love pervades the whole of their lives:(11) indeed by its busy generosity 
it grows better and grows greater. Therefore it far excels mere erotic 
inclination, which, selfishly pursued, soon enough fades wretchedly away.</P>
<P>This love is uniquely expressed and perfected through the appropriate 
enterprise of matrimony. The actions within marriage by which the couple are 
united intimately and chastely are noble and worthy ones. Expressed in a manner 
which is truly human, these actions promote that mutual self-giving by which 
spouses enrich each other with a joyful and a ready will. Sealed by mutual 
faithfulness and hallowed above all by Christ's sacrament, this love remains 
steadfastly true in body and in mind, in bright days or dark. It will never be 
profaned by adultery or divorce. Firmly established by the Lord, the unity of 
marriage will radiate from the equal personal dignity of wife and husband, a 
dignity acknowledged by mutual and total love. The constant fulfillment of the 
duties of this Christian vocation demands notable virtue. For this reason, 
strengthened by grace for holiness of life, the couple will painstakingly 
cultivate and pray for steadiness of love, large heartedness and the spirit of 
sacrifice.</P>
<P>Authentic conjugal love will be more highly prized, and wholesome public 
opinion created about it if Christian couples give outstanding witness to 
faithfulness and harmony in their love, and to their concern for educating their 
children also, if they do their part in bringing about the needed cultural, 
psychological and social renewal on behalf of marriage and the family. 
Especially in the heart of their own families, young people should be aptly and 
seasonably instructed in the dignity, duty and work of married love. Trained 
thus in the cultivation of chastity, they will be able at a suitable age to 
enter a marriage of their own after an honorable courtship.</P>
<P>50. Marriage and conjugal love are by their nature ordained toward the 
begetting and educating of children. Children are really the supreme gift of 
marriage and contribute very substantially to the welfare of their parents. The 
God Himself Who said, &quot;it is not good for man to be alone&quot; (Gen. 2:18) and &quot;Who 
made man from the beginning male and female&quot; (Matt. 19:4), wishing to share with 
man a certain special participation in His own creative work, blessed male and 
female, saying: &quot;Increase and multiply&quot; (Gen. 1:28). Hence, while not making the 
other purposes of matrimony of less account, the true practice of conjugal love, 
and the whole meaning of the family life which results from it, have this aim: 
that the couple be ready with stout hearts to cooperate with the love of the 
Creator and the Savior. Who through them will enlarge and enrich His own family 
day by day.</P>
<P>Parents should regard as their proper mission the task of transmitting human 
life and educating those to whom it has been transmitted. They should realize 
that they are thereby cooperators with the love of God the Creator, and are, so 
to speak, the interpreters of that love. Thus they will fulfil their task with 
human and Christian responsibility, and, with docile reverence toward God, will 
make decisions by common counsel and effort. Let them thoughtfully take into 
account both their own welfare and that of their children, those already born 
and those which the future may bring. For this accounting they need to reckon 
with both the material and the spiritual conditions of the times as well as of 
their state in life. Finally, they should consult the interests of the family 
group, of temporal society, and of the Church herself. The parents themselves 
and no one else should ultimately make this judgment in the sight of God. But in 
their manner of acting, spouses should be aware that they cannot proceed 
arbitrarily, but must always be governed according to a conscience dutifully 
conformed to the divine law itself, and should be submissive toward the Church's 
teaching office, which authentically interprets that law in the light of the 
Gospel. That divine law reveals and protects the integral meaning of conjugal 
love, and impels it toward a truly human fulfillment. Thus, trusting in divine 
Providence and refining the spirit of sacrifice,(12) married Christians glorify 
the Creator and strive toward fulfillment in Christ when with a generous human 
and Christian sense of responsibility they acquit themselves of the duty to 
procreate. Among the couples who fulfil their God-given task in this way, those 
merit special mention who with a gallant heart and with wise and common 
deliberation, undertake to bring up suitably even a relatively large family.(13)</P>
<P>Marriage to be sure is not instituted solely for procreation; rather, its 
very nature as an unbreakable compact between persons, and the welfare of the 
children, both demand that the mutual love of the spouses be embodied in a 
rightly ordered manner, that it grow and ripen. Therefore, marriage persists as 
a whole manner and communion of life, and maintains its value and 
indissolubility, even when despite the often intense desire of the couple, 
offspring are lacking.</P>
<P>51. This council realizes that certain modern conditions often keep couples 
from arranging their married lives harmoniously, and that they find themselves 
in circumstances where at least temporarily the size of their families should 
not be increased. As a result, the faithful exercise of love and the full 
intimacy of their lives is hard to maintain. But where the intimacy of married 
life is broken off, its faithfulness can sometimes be imperiled and its quality 
of fruitfulness ruined, for then the upbringing of the children and the courage 
to accept new ones are both endangered.</P>
<P>To these problems there are those who presume to offer dishonorable solutions 
indeed; they do not recoil even from the taking of life. But the Church issues 
the reminder that a true contradiction cannot exist between the divine laws 
pertaining to the transmission of life and those pertaining to authentic 
conjugal love.</P>
<P>For God, the Lord of life, has conferred on men the surpassing ministry of 
safeguarding life in a manner which is worthy of man. Therefore from the moment 
of its conception life must be guarded with the greatest care while abortion and 
infanticide are unspeakable crimes. The sexual characteristics of man and the 
human faculty of reproduction wonderfully exceed the dispositions of lower forms 
of life. Hence the acts themselves which are proper to conjugal love and which 
are exercised in accord with genuine human dignity must be honored with great 
reverence. Hence when there is question of harmonizing conjugal love with the 
responsible transmission of life, the moral aspects of any procedure does not 
depend solely on sincere intentions or on an evaluation of motives, but must be 
determined by objective standards. These, based on the nature of the human 
person and his acts, preserve the full sense of mutual self-giving and human 
procreation in the context of true love. Such a goal cannot be achieved unless 
the virtue of conjugal chastity is sincerely practiced. Relying on these 
principles, sons of the Church may not undertake methods of birth control which 
are found blameworthy by the teaching authority of the Church in its unfolding 
of the divine law.(14)</P>
<P>All should be persuaded that human life and the task of transmitting it are 
not realities bound up with this world alone. Hence they cannot be measured or 
perceived only in terms of it, but always have a bearing on the eternal destiny 
of men.</P>
<P>52. The family is a kind of school of deeper humanity. But if it is to 
achieve the full flowering of its life and mission, it needs the kindly 
communion of minds and the joint deliberation of spouses, as well as the 
painstaking cooperation of parents in the education of their children. The 
active presence of the father is highly beneficial to their formation. The 
children, especially the younger among them, need the care of their mother at 
home. This domestic role of hers must be safely preserved, though the legitimate 
social progress of women should not be underrated on that account.</P>
<P>Children should be so educated that as adults they can follow their vocation, 
including a religious one, with a mature sense of responsibility and can choose 
their state of life; if they marry, they can thereby establish their family in 
favorable moral, social and economic conditions. Parents or guardians should by 
prudent advice provide guidance to their young with respect to founding a 
family, and the young ought to listen gladly. At the same time no pressure, 
direct or indirect, should be put on the young to make them enter marriage or 
choose a specific partner.</P>
<P>Thus the family, in which the various generations come together and help one 
another grow wiser and harmonize personal rights with the other requirements of 
social life, is the foundation of society. All those, therefore, who exercise 
influence over communities and social groups should work efficiently for the 
welfare of marriage and the family. Public authority should regard it as a 
sacred duty to recognize, protect and promote their authentic nature, to shield 
public morality and to favor the prosperity of home life. The right of parents 
to beget and educate their children in the bosom of the family must be 
safeguarded. Children too who unhappily lack the blessing of a family should be 
protected by prudent legislation and various undertakings and assisted by the 
help they need.</P>
<P>Christians, redeeming the present time(13) and distinguishing eternal 
realities from their changing expressions, should actively promote the values of 
marriage and the family, both by the examples of their own lives and by 
cooperation with other men of good will. Thus when difficulties arise, 
Christians will provide, on behalf of family life, those necessities and helps 
which are suitably modern. To this end, the Christian instincts of the faithful, 
the upright moral consciences of men, and the wisdom and experience of persons 
versed in the sacred sciences will have much to contribute.</P>
<P>Those too who are skilled in other sciences, notably the medical, biological, 
social and psychological, can considerably advance the welfare of marriage and 
the family along with peace of conscience if by pooling their efforts they labor 
to explain more thoroughly the various conditions favoring a proper regulation 
of births.</P>
<P>It devolves on priests duly trained about family matters to nurture the 
vocation of spouses by a variety of pastoral means, by preaching God's word, by 
liturgical worship, and by other spiritual aids to conjugal and family life; to 
sustain them sympathetically and patiently in difficulties, and to make them 
courageous through love, so that families which are truly illustrious can be 
formed.</P>
<P>Various organizations, especially family associations, should try by their 
programs of instruction and action to strengthen young people and spouses 
themselves, particularly those recently wed, and to train them for family, 
social and apostolic life.</P>
<P>Finally, let the spouses themselves, made to the image of the living God and 
enjoying the authentic dignity of persons, be joined to one another(16) in equal 
affection, harmony of mind and the work of mutual sanctification. Thus, 
following Christ who is the principle of life,(17) by the sacrifices and joys of 
their vocation and through their faithful love, married people can become 
witnesses of the mystery of love which the Lord revealed to the world by His 
dying and His rising up to life again.(18)  </P>

<P><B>THE PROPER DEVELOPMENT OF CULTURE </B></P></CENTER>
<P>53. Man comes to a true and full humanity only through culture, that is 
through the cultivation of the goods and values of nature. Wherever human life 
is involved, therefore, nature and culture are quite intimately connected one 
with the other.</P>
<P>The word &quot;culture&quot; in its general sense indicates everything whereby man 
develops and perfects his many bodily and spiritual qualities; he strives by his 
knowledge and his labor, to bring the world itself under his control. He renders 
social life more human both in the family and the civic community, through 
improvement of customs and institutions. Throughout the course of time he 
expresses, communicates and conserves in his works, great spiritual experiences 
and desires, that they might be of advantage to the progress of many, even of 
the whole human family.</P>
<P>Thence it follows that human culture has necessarily a historical and social 
aspect and the word &quot;culture&quot; also often assumes a sociological and ethnological 
sense. According to this sense we speak of a plurality of cultures. Different 
styles of life and multiple scales of values arise from the diverse manner of 
using things, of laboring, of expressing oneself, of practicing religion, of 
forming customs, of establishing laws and juridic institutions, of cultivating 
the sciences, the arts and beauty. Thus the customs handed down to it form the 
patrimony proper to each human community. It is also in this way that there is 
formed the definite, historical milieu which enfolds the man of every nation and 
age and from which he draws the values which permit him to promote civilization.  </P>
<P><B>SECTION 1  <BR>The Circumstances of Culture in the World Today </B></P>
<P>54. The circumstances of the life of modern man have been so profoundly 
changed in their social and cultural aspects, that we can speak of a new age of 
human history.(1) New ways are open, therefore, for the perfection and the 
further extension of culture. These ways have been prepared by the enormous 
growth of natural, human and social sciences, by technical progress, and 
advances in developing and organizing means whereby men can communicate with one 
another. Hence the culture of today possesses particular characteristics: 
sciences which are called exact greatly develop critical judgment; the more 
recent psychological studies more profoundly explain human activity; historical 
studies make it much easier to see things in their mutable and evolutionary 
aspects, customs and usages are becoming more and more uniform; 
industrialization, urbanization, and other causes which promote community living 
create a mass-culture from which are born new ways of thinking, acting and 
making use of leisure. The increase of commerce between the various nations and 
human groups opens more widely to all the treasures of different civilizations 
and thus little by little, there develops a more universal form of human 
culture, which better promotes and expresses the unity of the human race to the 
degree that it preserves the particular aspects of the different civilizations.</P>
<P>55. From day to day, in every group or nation, there is an increase in the 
number of men and women who are conscious that they themselves are the authors 
and the artisans of the culture of their community. Throughout the whole world 
there is a mounting increase in the sense of autonomy as well as of 
responsibility. This is of paramount importance for the spiritual and moral 
maturity of the human race. This becomes more clear if we consider the 
unification of the world and the duty which is imposed upon us, that we build a 
better world based upon truth and justice. Thus we are witnesses of the birth of 
a new humanism, one in which man is defined first of all by this responsibility 
to his brothers and to history.</P>
<P>56. In these conditions, it is no cause of wonder that man, who senses his 
responsibility for the progress of culture, nourishes a high hope but also looks 
with anxiety upon many contradictory things which he must resolve:</P>
<P>What is to be done to prevent the increased exchanges between cultures, which 
should lead to a true and fruitful dialogue between groups and nations, from 
disturbing the life of communities, from destroying the wisdom received from 
ancestors, or from placing in danger the character proper to each people?</P>
<P>How is the dynamism and expansion of a new culture to be fostered without 
losing a living fidelity to the heritage of tradition. This question is of 
particular urgency when a culture which arises from the enormous progress of 
science and technology must be harmonized with a culture nourished by classical 
studies according to various traditions.</P>
<P>How can we quickly and progressively harmonize the proliferation of 
particular branches of study with the necessity of forming a synthesis of them, 
and of preserving among men the faculties of contemplation and observation which 
lead to wisdom?</P>
<P>What can be done to make all men partakers of cultural values in the world, 
when the human culture of those who are more competent is constantly becoming 
more refined and more complex?</P>
<P>Finally how is the autonomy which culture claims for itself to be recognized 
as legitimate without generating a notion of humanism which is merely 
terrestrial, and even contrary to religion itself.</P>
<P>In the midst of these conflicting requirements, human culture must evolve 
today in such a way that it can both develop the whole human person and aid man 
in those duties to whose fulfillment all are called, especially Christians 
fraternally united in one human family.  </P>
<P><B>SECTION 2  <BR>Some Principles for the Proper Development of Culture
</B></P>
<P>57. Christians, on pilgrimage toward the heavenly city, should seek and think 
of these things which are above.(2) This duty in no way decreases, rather it 
increases, the importance of their obligation to work with all men in the 
building of a more human world. Indeed, the mystery of the Christian faith 
furnishes them with an excellent stimulant and aid to fulfill this duty more 
courageously and especially to uncover the full meaning of this activity, one 
which gives to human culture its eminent place in the integral vocation of man.</P>
<P>When man develops the earth by the work of his hands or with the aid of 
technology, in order that it might bear fruit and become a dwelling worthy of 
the whole human family and when he consciously takes part in the life of social 
groups, he carries out the design of God manifested at the beginning of time, 
that he should subdue the earth, perfect creation and develop himself. At the 
same time he obeys the commandment of Christ that he place himself at the 
service of his brethren.</P>
<P>Furthermore, when man gives himself to the various disciplines of philosophy, 
history and of mathematical and natural science, and when he cultivates the 
arts, he can do very much to elevate the human family to a more sublime 
understanding of truth, goodness, and beauty, and to the formation of considered 
opinions which have universal value. Thus mankind may be more clearly 
enlightened by that marvelous Wisdom which was with God from all eternity, 
composing all things with him, rejoicing in the earth, delighting in the sons of 
men.(4)</P>
<P>In this way, the human spirit, being less subjected to material things, can 
be more easily drawn to the worship and contemplation of the Creator. Moreover, 
by the impulse of grace, he is disposed to acknowledge the Word of God, Who 
before He became flesh in order to save all and to sum up all in Himself was 
already &quot;in the world&quot; as &quot;the true light which enlightens every man&quot; (John 
1:9-10).(5)</P>
<P>Indeed today's progress in science and technology can foster a certain 
exclusive emphasis on observable data, and an agnosticism about everything else. 
For the methods of investigation which these sciences use can be wrongly 
considered as the supreme rule of seeking the whole truth. By virtue of their 
methods these sciences cannot penetrate to the intimate notion of things. Indeed 
the danger is present that man, confiding too much in the discoveries of today, 
may think that he is sufficient unto himself and no longer seek the higher 
things.</P>
<P>Those unfortunate results, however, do not necessarily follow from the 
culture of today, nor should they lead us into the temptation of not 
acknowledging its positive values. Among these values are included: scientific 
study and fidelity toward truth in scientific inquiries, the necessity of 
working together with others in technical groups, a sense of international 
solidarity, a clearer awareness of the responsibility of experts to aid and even 
to protect men, the desire to make the conditions of life more favorable for 
all, especially for those who are poor in culture or who are deprived of the 
opportunity to exercise responsibility. All of these provide some preparation 
for the acceptance of the message of the Gospel a preparation which can be 
animated by divine charity through Him Who has come to save the world.</P>
<P>58. There are many ties between the message of salvation and human culture. 
For God, revealing Himself to His people to the extent of a full manifestation 
of Himself in His Incarnate Son, has spoken according to the culture proper to 
each epoch.</P>
<P>Likewise the Church, living in various circumstances in the course of time, 
has used the discoveries of different cultures so that in her preaching she 
might spread and explain the message of Christ to all nations, that she might 
examine it and more deeply understand it, that she might give it better 
expression in liturgical celebration and in the varied life of the community of 
the faithful.</P>
<P>But at the same time, the Church, sent to all peoples of every time and 
place, is not bound exclusively and indissolubly to any race or nation, any 
particular way of life or any customary way of life recent or ancient. Faithful 
to her own tradition and at the same time conscious of her universal mission, 
she can enter into communion with the various civilizations, to their enrichment 
and the enrichment of the Church herself.</P>
<P>The Gospel of Christ constantly renews the life and culture of fallen man, it 
combats and removes the errors and evils resulting from the permanent allurement 
of sin. It never eases to purify and elevate the morality of peoples. By riches 
coming from above, it makes fruitful, as it were from within, the spiritual 
qualities and traditions of every people of every age. It strengthens, 
perfects and restores(6) them in Christ. Thus the Church, in the very 
fulfillment of her own function,(7) stimulates and advances human and civic 
culture; by her action, also by her liturgy, she leads them toward interior 
liberty.</P>
<P>59. For the above reasons, the Church recalls to the mind of all that culture 
is to be subordinated to the integral perfection of the human person, to the 
good of the community and of the whole society. Therefore it is necessary to 
develop the human faculties in such a way that there results a growth of the 
faculty of admiration, of intuition, of contemplation, of making personal 
judgment, of developing a religious, moral and social sense.</P>
<P>Culture, because it flows immediately from the spiritual and social character 
of man, has constant need of a just liberty in order to develop; it needs also 
the legitimate possibility of exercising its autonomy according to its own 
principles. It therefore rightly demands respect and enjoys a certain 
inviolability within the limits of the common good, as long, of course, as it 
preserves the rights of the individual and the community, whether particular or 
universal.</P>
<P>This Sacred Synod, therefore, recalling the teaching of the first Vatican 
Council, declares that there are &quot;two orders of knowledge&quot; which are distinct, 
namely faith and reason; and that the Church does not forbid that &quot;the human 
arts and disciplines use their own principles and their proper method, each in 
its own domain&quot;; therefore &quot;acknowledging this just liberty,&quot; this Sacred Synod 
affirms the legitimate autonomy of human culture and especially of the 
sciences.(8)</P>
<P>All this supposes that, within the limits of morality and the common utility, 
man can freely search for the truth, express his opinion and publish it; that he 
can practice any art he chooses; that finally, he can avail himself of true 
information concerning events of a public nature.(9)</P>
<P>As for public authority, it is not its function to determine the character of 
the civilization, but rather to establish the conditions and to use the means 
which are capable of fostering the life of culture among all even within the 
minorities of a nation.(10) It is necessary to do everything possible to prevent 
culture from being turned away from its proper end and made to serve as an 
instrument of political or economic power.  </P>
<P><B>SECTION 3   <BR>Some More Urgent Duties of Christians in Regard to Culture </B></P>
<P>60. It is now possible to free most of humanity from the misery of ignorance. 
Therefore the duty most consonant with our times, especially for Christians, is 
that of working diligently for fundamental decisions to be taken in economic and 
political affairs, both on the national and international level which will 
everywhere recognize and satisfy the right of all to a human and social culture 
in conformity with the dignity of the human person without any discrimination of 
race, sex, nation, religion or social condition. Therefore it is necessary to 
provide all with a sufficient quantity of cultural benefits, especially of those 
which constitute the so-called fundamental culture lest very many be prevented 
from cooperating in the promotion of the common good in a truly human manner 
because of illiteracy and a lack of responsible activity.</P>
<P>We must strive to provide for those men who are gifted the possibility of 
pursuing higher studies; and in such a way that, as far as possible, they may 
occupy in society those duties, offices and services which are in harmony with 
their natural aptitude and the competence they have acquired.(11) Thus each man 
and the social groups of every people will be able to attain the full 
development of their culture in conformity with their qualities and traditions.</P>
<P>Everything must be done to make everyone conscious of the right to culture 
and the duty he has of developing himself culturally and of helping others. 
Sometimes there exist conditions of life and of work which impede the cultural 
striving of men and destroy in them the eagerness for culture. This is 
especially true of farmers and workers. It is necessary to provide for them 
those working conditions which will not impede their human culture but rather favor it. Women now work in almost all spheres. It is fitting that they are able 
to assume their proper role in accordance with their own nature. It will belong 
to all to acknowledge and favor the proper and necessary participation of women 
in the cultural life.</P>
<P>61. Today it is more difficult to form a synthesis of the various disciplines 
of knowledge and the arts than it was formerly. For while the mass and the 
diversity of cultural factors are increasing, there is a decrease in each man's 
faculty of perceiving and unifying these things, so that the image of &quot;universal 
man&quot; is being lost sight of more and more. Nevertheless it remains each man's 
duty to retain an understanding of the whole human person in which the values of 
intellect, will, conscience and fraternity are preeminent. These values are all 
rooted in God the Creator and have been wonderfully restored and elevated in 
Christ.</P>
<P>The family is, as it were, the primary mother and nurse of this education. 
There, the children, in an atmosphere of love, more easily learn the correct 
order of things, while proper forms of human culture impress themselves in an 
almost unconscious manner upon the mind of the developing adolescent.</P>
<P>Opportunities for the same education are to be found also in the societies of 
today, due especially to the increased circulation of books and to the new means 
of cultural and social communication which can foster a universal culture. With 
the more or less generalized reduction of working hours, the leisure time of 
most men has increased. May this leisure be used properly to relax, to fortify 
the health of soul and body through spontaneous study and activity, through 
tourism which refines man's character and enriches him with understanding of 
others, through sports activity which helps to preserve equilibrium of spirit 
even in the community, and to establish fraternal relations among men of all 
conditions, nations and races. Let Christians cooperate so that the cultural 
manifestations and collective activity characteristic of our time may be imbued 
with a human and a Christian spirit.</P>
<P>All these leisure activities however are not able to bring man to a full 
cultural development unless there is at the same time a profound inquiry into 
the meaning of culture and science for the human person.</P>
<P>62. Although the Church has contributed much to the development of culture, 
experience shows that, for circumstantial reasons, it is sometimes difficult to 
harmonize culture with Christian teaching. These difficulties do not necessarily 
harm the life of faith, rather they can stimulate the mind to a deeper and more 
accurate understanding of the faith. The recent studies and findings of science, 
history and philosophy raise new questions which effect life and which demand 
new theological investigations. Furthermore, theologians, within the 
requirements and methods proper to theology, are invited to seek continually for 
more suitable ways of communicating doctrine to the men of their times; for the 
deposit of Faith or the truths are one thing and the manner in which they are 
enunciated, in the same meaning and understanding, is another.(12) In pastoral 
care, sufficient use must be made not only of theological principles, but also 
of the findings of the secular sciences, especially of psychology and sociology, 
so that the faithful may be brought to a more adequate and mature life of faith.</P>
<P>Literature and the arts are also, in their own way, of great importance to 
the life of the Church. They strive to make known the proper nature of man, his 
problems and his experiences in trying to know and perfect both himself and the 
world. They have much to do with revealing mans place in history and in the 
world; with illustrating the miseries and joys, the needs and strengths of man 
and with foreshadowing a better life for him. Thus they are able to elevate human 
life, expressed in multifold forms according to various times and regions.</P>
<P>Efforts must be made so that those who foster these arts feel that the Church 
recognizes their activity and so that, enjoying orderly liberty, they may 
initiate more friendly relations with the Christian community. The Church 
acknowledges also new forms of art which are adapted to our age and are in 
keeping with the characteristics of various nations and regions. They may be 
brought into the sanctuary since they raise the mind to God, once the manner of 
expression is adapted and they are conformed to liturgical requirements.(13)</P>
<P>Thus the knowledge of God is better manifested and the preaching of the 
Gospel becomes clearer to human intelligence and shows itself to be relevant to 
man's actual conditions of life.</P>
<P>May the faithful, therefore, live in very close union with the other men of 
their time and may they strive to understand perfectly their way of thinking and 
judging, as expressed in their culture. Let them blend new sciences and theories 
and the understanding of the most recent discoveries with Christian morality and 
the teaching of Christian doctrine, so that their religious culture and morality 
may keep pace with scientific knowledge and with the constantly progressing 
technology. Thus they will be able to interpret and evaluate all things in a 
truly Christian spirit.</P>
<P>Let those who teach theology in seminaries and universities strive to 
collaborate with men versed in the other sciences through a sharing of their 
resources and points of view. Theological inquiry should pursue a profound 
understanding of revealed truth; at the same time it should not neglect close 
contact with its own time that it may be able to help these men skilled in 
various disciplines to attain to a better understanding of the faith. This 
common effort will greatly aid the formation of priests, who will be able to 
present to our contemporaries the doctrine of the Church concerning God, man and 
the world, in a manner more adapted to them so that they may receive it more 
willingly.(14) Furthermore, it is to be hoped that many of the laity will 
receive a sufficient formation in the sacred sciences and that some will 
dedicate themselves professionally to these studies, developing and deepening 
them by their own labors. In order that they may fulfill their function, let it 
be recognized that all the faithful, whether clerics or laity, possess a lawful 
freedom of inquiry, freedom of thought and of expressing their mind with 
humility and fortitude in those matters on which they enjoy competence.(16)

<P><B>ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL LIFE </B></P></CENTER>
<P>63. In the economic and social realms, too, the dignity and complete vocation 
of the human person and the welfare of society as a whole are to be respected 
and promoted. For man is the source, the center, and the purpose of all economic 
and social life.</P>
<P>Like other areas of social life, the economy of today is marked by man's 
increasing domination over nature, by closer and more intense relationships 
between citizens, groups, and countries and their mutual dependence, and by the 
increased intervention of the state. At the same time progress in the methods of 
production and in the exchange of goods and services has made the economy an 
instrument capable of better meeting the intensified needs of the human family.</P>
<P>Reasons for anxiety, however, are not lacking. Many people, especially in 
economically advanced areas, seem, as it were, to be ruled by economics, so that 
almost their entire personal and social life is permeated with a certain economic 
way of thinking. Such is true both of nations that favor a collective economy 
and of others. At the very time when the development of economic life could 
mitigate social inequalities (provided that it be guided and coordinated in a 
reasonable and human way), it is often made to embitter them; or, in some 
places, it even results in a decline of the social status of the underprivileged 
and in contempt for the poor. While an immense number of people still lack the 
absolute necessities of life, some, even in less advanced areas, live in luxury 
or squander wealth. Extravagance and wretchedness exist side by side. While a 
few enjoy very great power of choice, the majority are deprived of almost all 
possibility of acting on their own initiative and responsibility, and often 
subsist in living and working conditions unworthy of the human person.</P>
<P>A similar lack of economic and social balance is to be noticed between 
agriculture, industry, and the services, and also between different parts of one 
and the same country. The contrast between the economically more advanced 
countries and other countries is becoming more serious day by day, and the very 
peace of the world can be jeopardized thereby.</P>
<P>Our contemporaries are coming to feel these inequalities with an ever sharper 
awareness, since they are thoroughly convinced that the ampler technical and 
economic possibilities which the world of today enjoys can and should correct 
this unhappy state of affairs. Hence, many reforms in the socioeconomic realm 
and a change of mentality and attitude are required of all. For this reason the 
Church down through the centuries and in the light of the Gospel has worked out 
the principles of justice and equity demanded by right reason both for 
individual and social life and for international life, and she has proclaimed 
them especially in recent times. This sacred council intends to strengthen these 
principles according to the circumstances of this age and to set forth certain 
guidelines, especially with regard to the requirements of economic 
development.(1)  </P>
<P><B>SECTION 1  <BR>Economic Development </B></P>
<P>64. Today more than ever before attention is rightly given to the increase of 
the production of agricultural and industrial goods and of the rendering of 
services, for the purpose of making provision for the growth of population and 
of satisfying the increasing desires of the human race. Therefore, technical 
progress, an inventive spirit, an eagerness to create and to expand enterprises, 
the application of methods of production, and the strenuous efforts of all who 
engage in production&#8212;in a word, all the elements making for such 
development&#8212;must be promoted. The fundamental finality of this production is not 
the mere increase of products nor profit or control but rather the service of 
man, and indeed of the whole man with regard for the full range of his material 
needs and the demands of his intellectual, moral, spiritual, and religious life; 
this applies to every man whatsoever and to every group of men, of every race 
and of every part of the world. Consequently, economic activity is to be carried 
on according to its own methods and laws within the limits of the moral order,&quot; 
so that God's plan for mankind may be realized.(3)</P>
<P>65. Economic development must remain under man's determination and must not 
be left to the judgment of a few men or groups possessing too much economic 
power or of the political community alone or of certain more powerful nations. 
It is necessary, on the contrary, that at every level the largest possible 
number of people and, when it is a question of international relations, all 
nations have an active share in directing that development. There is need as 
well of the coordination and fitting and harmonious combination of the 
spontaneous efforts of individuals and of free groups with the undertakings of 
public authorities.</P>
<P>Growth is not to be left solely to a kind of mechanical course of the 
economic activity of individuals, nor to the authority of government. For this 
reason, doctrines which obstruct the necessary reforms under the guise of a 
false liberty, and those which subordinate the basic rights of individual 
persons and groups to the collective organization of production must be shown to 
be erroneous.(4)</P>
<P>Citizens, on the other hand, should remember that it is their right and duty, 
which is also to be recognized by the civil authority, to contribute to the true 
progress of their own community according to their ability. Especially in 
underdeveloped areas, where all resources must urgently be employed, those who 
hold back their unproductive resources or who deprive their community of the 
material or spiritual aid that it needs&#8212;saving the personal right of 
migration&#8212;gravely endanger the common good.</P>
<P>66. To satisfy the demands of justice and equity, strenuous efforts must be 
made, without disregarding the rights of persons or the natural qualities of 
each country, to remove as quickly as possible the immense economic 
inequalities, which now exist and in many cases are growing and which are 
connected with individual and social discrimination. Likewise, in many areas, in 
view of the special difficulties of agriculture relative to the raising and 
selling of produce, country people must be helped both to increase and to market 
what they produce, and to introduce the necessary development and renewal and 
also obtain a fair income. Otherwise, as too often happens, they will remain in 
the condition of lower-class citizens. Let farmers themselves, especially young 
ones, apply themselves to perfecting their professional skill, for without it, 
there can be no agricultural advance.(5)</P>
<P>Justice and equity likewise require that the mobility, which is necessary in 
a developing economy, be regulated in such a way as to keep the life of 
individuals and their families from becoming insecure and precarious. When 
workers come from another country or district and contribute to the economic 
advancement of a nation or region by their labor, all discrimination as regards 
wages and working conditions must be carefully avoided. All the people, 
moreover, above all the public authorities, must treat them not as mere tools of 
production but as persons, and must help them to bring their families to live 
with them and to provide themselves with a decent dwelling; they must also see 
to it that these workers are incorporated into the social life of the country or 
region that receives them. Employment opportunities, however, should be created 
in their own areas as far as possible.</P>
<P>In economic affairs which today are subject to change, as in the new forms of 
industrial society in which automation, for example, is advancing, care must be 
taken that sufficient and suitable work and the possibility of the appropriate 
technical and professional formation are furnished. The livelihood and the human 
dignity especially of those who are in very difficult conditions because of 
illness or old age must be guaranteed.  </P>
<P><B>SECTION 2  <BR>Certain Principles Governing Socio-Economic Life as a Whole </B></P>
<P>67. Human labor which is expended in the production and exchange of goods or 
in the performance of economic services is superior to the other elements of 
economic life, for the latter have only the nature of tools.</P>
<P>This labor, whether it is engaged in independently or hired by someone else, 
comes immediately from the person, who as it were stamps the things of nature 
with his seal and subdues them to his will. By his labor a man ordinarily 
supports himself and his family, is joined to his fellow men and serves them, 
and can exercise genuine charity and be a partner in the work of bringing divine 
creation to perfection. Indeed, we hold that through labor offered to God man is 
associated with the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, Who conferred an eminent 
dignity on labor when at Nazareth He worked with His own hands. From this there 
follows for every man the duty of working faithfully and also the right to work. 
It is the duty of society, moreover, according to the circumstances prevailing 
in it, and in keeping with its role, to help the citizens to find sufficient 
employment. Finally, remuneration for labor is to be such that man may be 
furnished the means to cultivate worthily his own material, social, cultural, 
and spiritual life and that of his dependents, in view of the function and 
productiveness of each one, the conditions of the factory or workshop, and the 
common good.(6)</P>
<P>Since economic activity for the most part implies the associated work of 
human beings, any way of organizing and directing it which may be detrimental to 
any working men and women would be wrong and inhuman. It happens too often, 
however, even in our days, that workers are reduced to the level of being slaves 
to their own work. This is by no means justified by the so-called economic laws. 
The entire process of productive work, therefore, must be adapted to the needs 
of the person and to his way of life, above all to his domestic life, especially 
in respect to mothers of families, always with due regard for sex and age. The 
opportunity, moreover, should be granted to workers to unfold their own 
abilities and personality through the performance of their work. Applying their 
time and strength to their employment with a due sense of responsibility, they 
should also all enjoy sufficient rest and leisure to cultivate their familial, 
cultural, social and religious life. They should also have the opportunity 
freely to develop the energies and potentialities which perhaps they cannot 
bring to much fruition in their professional work.</P>
<P>68. In economic enterprises it is persons who are joined together, that is, 
free and independent human beings created to the image of God. Therefore, with 
attention to the functions of each&#8212;owners or employers, management or labor&#8212;and 
without doing harm to the necessary unity of management, the active sharing of 
all in the administration and profits of these enterprises in ways to be 
properly determined is to be promoted.(7) Since more often, however, decisions 
concerning economic and social conditions, on which the future lot of the 
workers and of their children depends, are made not within the business itself 
but by institutions on a higher level, the workers themselves should have a 
share also in determining these conditions&#8212;in person or through freely elected 
delegates.</P>
<P>Among the basic rights of the human person is to be numbered the right of 
freely founding unions for working people. These should be able truly to 
represent them and to contribute to the organizing of economic life in the right 
way. Included is the right of freely taking part in the activity of these unions 
without risk of reprisal. Through this orderly participation joined to 
progressive economic and social formation, all will grow day by day in the 
awareness of their own function and responsibility, and thus they will be 
brought to feel that they are comrades in the whole task of economic development 
and in the attainment of the universal common good according to their capacities 
and aptitudes.</P>
<P>When, however, socio-economic disputes arise, efforts must be made to come to 
a peaceful settlement. Although recourse must always be had first to a sincere 
dialogue between the parties, a strike, nevertheless, can remain even in 
present-day circumstances a necessary, though ultimate, aid for the defense of 
the workers' own rights and the fulfillment of their just desires. As soon as 
possible, however, ways should be sought to resume negotiation and the 
discussion of reconciliation.</P>
<P>69. God intended the earth with everything contained in it for the use of all 
human beings and peoples. Thus, under the leadership of justice and in the 
company of charity, created goods should be in abundance for all in like 
manner.(8) Whatever the forms of property may be, as adapted to the legitimate 
institutions of peoples, according to diverse and changeable circumstances, 
attention must always be paid to this universal destination of earthly goods. In 
using them, therefore, man should regard the external things that he 
legitimately possesses not only as his own but also as common in the sense that 
they should be able to benefit not only him but also others.(9) On the other 
hand, the right of having a share of earthly goods sufficient for oneself and 
one's family belongs to everyone. The Fathers and Doctors of the Church held 
this opinion, teaching that men are obliged to come to the relief of the poor 
and to do so not merely out of their superfluous goods.(10) If one is in extreme 
necessity, he has the right to procure for himself what he needs out of the 
riches of others.(11) Since there are so many people prostrate with hunger in 
the world, this sacred council urges all, both individuals and governments, to 
remember the aphorism of the Fathers, &quot;Feed the man dying of hunger, because if 
you have not fed him, you have killed him,&quot;(12) and really to share and employ 
their earthly goods, according to the ability of each, especially by supporting 
individuals or peoples with the aid by which they may be able to help and 
develop themselves.</P>
<P>In economically less advanced societies the common destination of earthly 
goods is partly satisfied by means of the customs and traditions proper to the 
community, by which the absolutely necessary things are furnished to each 
member. An effort must be made, however, to avoid regarding certain customs as 
altogether unchangeable, if they no longer answer the new needs of this age. On 
the other hand, imprudent action should not be taken against respectable customs 
which, provided they are suitably adapted to present-day circumstances, do not 
cease to be very useful. Similarly, in highly developed nations a body of social 
institutions dealing with protection and security can, for its own part, bring 
to reality the common destination of earthly goods. Family and social services, 
especially those that provide for culture and education, should be further 
promoted. When all these things are being organized, vigilance is necessary to 
present the citizens from being led into a certain inactivity vis-a-vis society 
or from rejecting the burden of taking up office or from refusing to serve.</P>
<P>70. Investments, for their part, must be directed toward procuring employment 
and sufficient income for the people both now and in the future. Whoever makes 
decisions concerning these investments and the planning of the economy&#8212;whether 
they be individuals or groups of public authorities&#8212;are bound to keep these 
objectives in mind and to recognize their serious obligation of watching, on the 
one hand, that provision be made for the necessities required for a decent life 
both of individuals and of the whole community and, on the other, of looking out 
for the future and of establishing a right balance between the needs of 
present-day consumption, both individual and collective, and the demands of 
investing for the generation to come. They should also always bear in mind the 
urgent needs of underdeveloped countries or regions. In monetary matters they 
should beware of hurting the welfare of their own country or of other countries. 
Care should also be taken lest the economically weak countries unjustly suffer 
any loss from a change in the value of money.</P>
<P>71. Since property and other forms of private ownership of external goods 
contribute to the expression of the personality, and since, moreover, they 
furnish one an occasion to exercise his function in society and in the economy, 
it is very important that the access of both individuals and communities to some 
ownership of external goods be fostered</P>
<P>Private property or some ownership of external goods confers on everyone a 
sphere wholly necessary for the autonomy of the person and the family, and it 
should be regarded as an extension of human freedom. Lastly, since it adds 
incentives for carrying on one's function and charge, it constitutes one of the 
conditions for civil liberties.(13)</P>
<P>The forms of such ownership or property are varied today and are becoming 
increasingly diversified. They all remain, however, a cause of security not to 
be underestimated, in spite of social funds, rights, and services provided by 
society. This is true not only of material property but also of immaterial 
things such as professional capacities.</P>
<P>The right of private ownership, however, is not opposed to the right inherent 
in various forms of public property. Goods can be transferred to the public 
domain only by the competent authority, according to the demands and within the 
limits of the common good, and with fair compensation. Furthermore, it is the 
right of public authority to prevent anyone from abusing his private property to 
the detriment of the common good.(14)</P>
<P>By its very nature private property has a social quality which is based on 
the law of the common destination of earthly goods.(15) If this social quality 
is overlooked, property often becomes an occasion of passionate desires for 
wealth and serious disturbances, so that a pretext is given to the attackers for 
calling the right itself into question.</P>
<P>In many underdeveloped regions there are large or even extensive rural 
estates which are only slightly cultivated or lie completely idle for the sake 
of profit, while the majority of the people either are without land or have only 
very small fields, and, on the other hand, it is evidently urgent to increase 
the productivity of the fields. Not infrequently those who are hired to work for 
the landowners or who till a portion of the land as tenants receive a wage or 
income unworthy of a human being, lack decent housing and are exploited by 
middlemen. Deprived of all security, they live under such personal servitude 
that almost every opportunity of acting on their own initiative and 
responsibility is denied to them and all advancement in human culture and all 
sharing in social and political life is forbidden to them. According to the 
different cases, therefore, reforms are necessary: that income may grow, working 
conditions should be improved, security in employment increased, and an 
incentive to working on one's own initiative given. Indeed, insufficiently 
cultivated estates should be distributed to those who can make these lands 
fruitful; in this case, the necessary things and means, especially educational 
aids and the right facilities for cooperative organization, must be supplied. 
Whenever, nevertheless, the common good requires expropriation, compensation 
must be reckoned in equity after all the circumstances have been weighed.</P>
<P>72. Christians who take an active part in present-day socio-economic 
development and fight for justice and charity should be convinced that they can 
make a great contribution to the prosperity of mankind and to the peace of the 
world. In these activities let them, either as individuals or as members of 
groups, give a shining example. Having acquired the absolutely necessary skill 
and experience, they should observe the right order in their earthly activities 
in faithfulness to Christ and His Gospel. Thus their whole life, both individual 
and social, will be permeated with the spirit of the beatitudes, notably with a 
spirit of poverty.</P>
<P>Whoever in obedience to Christ seeks first the Kingdom of God, takes 
therefrom a stronger and purer love for helping all his brethren and for 
perfecting the work of justice under the inspiration of charity.(16)  </P>

<P><B>THE LIFE OF THE POLITICAL COMMUNITY</B> </P></CENTER>
<P>73. In our day, profound changes are apparent also in the structure and 
institutions of peoples. These result from their cultural, economic and social 
evolution. Such changes have a great influence on the life of the political 
community, especially regarding the rights and duties of all in the exercise of 
civil freedom and in the attainment of the common good, and in organizing the 
relations of citizens among themselves and with respect to public authority.</P>
<P>The present keener sense of human dignity has given rise in many parts of the 
world to attempts to bring about a politico-juridical order which will give 
better protection to the rights of the person in public life. These include the 
right freely to meet and form associations, the right to express one's own 
opinion and to profess one's religion both publicly and privately. The 
protection of the rights of a person is indeed a necessary condition so that 
citizens, individually or collectively, can take an active part in the life and 
government of the state.</P>
<P>Along with cultural, economic and social development, there is a growing 
desire among many people to play a greater part in organizing the life of the 
political community. In the conscience of many arises an increasing concern that 
the rights of minorities be recognized, without any neglect for their duties 
toward the political community. In addition, there is a steadily growing respect 
for men of other opinions or other religions. At the same time, there is wider 
cooperation to guarantee the actual exercise of personal rights to all citizens, 
and not only to a few privileged individuals.</P>
<P>However, those political systems, prevailing in some parts of the world are 
to be reproved which hamper civic or religious freedom, victimize large numbers 
through avarice and political crimes, and divert the exercise of authority from 
the service of the common good to the interests of one or another faction or of 
the rulers themselves.</P>
<P>There is no better way to establish political life on a truly human basis 
than by fostering an inward sense of justice and kindliness, and of service to 
the common good, and by strengthening basic convictions as to the true nature of 
the political community and the aim, right exercise, and sphere of action of 
public authority.</P>
<P>74. Men, families and the various groups which make up the civil community 
are aware that they cannot achieve a truly human life by their own unaided 
efforts. They see the need for a wider community, within which each one makes 
his specific contribution every day toward an ever broader realization of the 
common good.(1) For this purpose they set up a political community according to 
various forms. The political community exists, consequently, for the sake of the 
common good, in which it finds its full justification and significance, and the 
source of its inherent legitimacy. Indeed, the common good embraces the sum of 
those conditions of the social life whereby men, families and associations more 
adequately and readily may attain their own perfection.(2)</P>
<P>Yet the people who come together in the political community are many and 
diverse, and they have every right to prefer divergent solutions. If the 
political community is not to be torn apart while everyone follows his own 
opinion, there must be an authority to direct the energies of all citizens 
toward the common good, not in a mechanical or despotic fashion, but by acting 
above all as a moral force which appeals to each one's freedom and sense of 
responsibility.</P>
<P>It is clear, therefore, that the political community and public authority are 
founded on human nature and hence belong to the order designed by God, even 
though the choice of a political regime and the appointment of rulers are left 
to the free will of citizens.(3)</P>
<P>It follows also that political authority, both in the community as such and 
in the representative bodies of the state, must always be exercised within the 
limits of the moral order and directed toward the common good&#8212;with a dynamic 
concept of that good&#8212;according to the juridical order legitimately established 
or due to be established. When authority is so exercised, citizens are bound in 
conscience to obey.(4) Accordingly, the responsibility, dignity and importance 
of leaders are indeed clear.</P>
<P>But where citizens are oppressed by a public authority overstepping its 
competence, they should not protest against those things which are objectively 
required for the common good; but it is legitimate for them to defend their own 
rights and the rights of their fellow citizens against the abuse of this 
authority, while keeping within those limits drawn by the natural law and the 
Gospels.</P>
<P>According to the character of different peoples and their historic 
development, the political community can, however, adopt a variety of concrete 
solutions in its structures and the organization of public authority. For the 
benefit of the whole human family, these solutions must always contribute to the 
formation of a type of man who will be cultivated, peace-loving and 
well-disposed towards all his fellow men.</P>
<P>75. It is in full conformity with human nature that there should be 
juridico-political structures providing all citizens in an ever better fashion 
and without any discrimination the practical possibility of freely and actively 
taking part in the establishment of the juridical foundations of the political 
community and in the direction of public affairs, in fixing the terms of 
reference of the various public bodies and in the election of political 
leaders.(5) All citizens, therefore, should be mindful of the right and also the 
duty to use their free vote to further the common good. The Church praises and 
esteems the work of those who for the good of men devote themselves to the 
service of the state and take on the burdens of this office.</P>
<P>If the citizens' responsible cooperation is to produce the good results which 
may be expected in the normal course of political life, there must be a statute 
of positive law providing for a suitable division of the functions and bodies of 
authority and an efficient and independent system for the protection of rights. 
The rights of all persons, families and groups, and their practical application, 
must be recognized, respected and furthered, together with the duties binding on 
all citizen.(6) Among the latter, it will be well to recall the duty of 
rendering the political community such material and personal service as are 
required by the common good. Rulers must be careful not to hamper the 
development of family, social or cultural groups, nor that of intermediate 
bodies or organizations, and not to deprive them of opportunities for legitimate 
and constructive activity; they should willingly seek rather to promote the 
orderly pursuit of such activity. Citizens, for their part, either individually 
or collectively, must be careful not to attribute excessive power to public 
authority, not to make exaggerated and untimely demands upon it in their own 
interests, lessening in this way the responsible role of persons, families and 
social groups.</P>
<P>The complex circumstances of our day make it necessary for public authority 
to intervene more often in social, economic and cultural matters in order to 
bring about favorable conditions which will give more effective help to citizens 
and groups in their free pursuit of man's total well-being. The relations, 
however, between socialization and the autonomy and development of the person 
can be understood in different ways according to various regions and the 
evolution of peoples. But when the exercise of rights is restricted temporarily 
for the common good, freedom should be restored immediately upon change of 
circumstances. Moreover, it is inhuman for public authority to fall back on 
dictatorial systems or totalitarian methods which violate the rights of the 
person or social groups.</P>
<P>Citizens must cultivate a generous and loyal spirit of patriotism, but 
without being narrow-minded. This means that they will always direct their 
attention to the good of the whole human family, united by the different ties 
which bind together races, people and nations.</P>
<P>All Christians must be aware of their own specific vocation within the 
political community. It is for them to give an example by their sense of 
responsibility and their service of the common good. In this way they are to 
demonstrate concretely how authority can be compatible with freedom, personal 
initiative with the solidarity of the whole social organism, and the advantages 
of unity with fruitful diversity. They must recognize the legitimacy of 
different opinions with regard to temporal solutions, and respect citizens, who, 
even as a group, defend their points of view by honest methods. Political 
parties, for their part, must promote those things which in their judgement are 
required for the common good; it is never allowable to give their interests 
priority over the common good.</P>
<P>Great care must be taken about civic and political formation, which is of the 
utmost necessity today for the population as a whole, and especially for youth, 
so that all citizens can play their part in the life of the political community. 
Those who are suited or can become suited should prepare themselves for the 
difficult, but at the same time, the very noble art of politics,(8) and should 
seek to practice this art without regard for their own interests or for material 
advantages. With integrity and wisdom, they must take action against any form of 
injustice and tyranny, against arbitrary domination by an individual or a 
political party and any intolerance. They should dedicate themselves to the 
service of all with sincerity and fairness, indeed, with the charity and 
fortitude demanded by political life.</P>
<P>76. It is very important, especially where a pluralistic society prevails, 
that there be a correct notion of the relationship between the political 
community and the Church, and a clear distinction between the tasks which 
Christians undertake, individually or as a group, on their own responsibility as 
citizens guided by the dictates of a Christian conscience, and the activities 
which, in union with their pastors, they carry out in the name of the Church.</P>
<P>The Church, by reason of her role and competence, is not identified in any 
way with the political community nor bound to any political system. She is at 
once a sign and a safeguard of the transcendent character of the human person.</P>
<P>The Church and the political community in their own fields are autonomous and 
independent from each other. Yet both, under different titles, are devoted to 
the personal and social vocation of the same men. The more that both foster 
sounder cooperation between themselves with due consideration for the 
circumstances of time and place, the more effective will their service be 
exercised for the good of all. For man's horizons are not limited only to the 
temporal order; while living in the context of human history, he preserves 
intact his eternal vocation. The Church, for her part, founded on the love of 
the Redeemer, contributes toward the reign of justice and charity within the 
borders of a nation and between nations. By preaching the truths of the Gospel, 
and bringing to bear on all fields of human endeavor the light of her doctrine 
and of a Christian witness, she respects and fosters the political freedom and 
responsibility of citizens.</P>
<P>The Apostles, their successors and those who cooperate with them, are sent to 
announce to mankind Christ, the Savior. Their apostolate is based on the power 
of God, Who very often shows forth the strength of the Gospel on the weakness of 
its witnesses. All those dedicated to the ministry of God's Word must use the 
ways and means proper to the Gospel which in a great many respects differ from 
the means proper to the earthly city.</P>
<P>There are, indeed, close links between earthly things and those elements of 
man's condition which transcend the world. The Church herself makes use of 
temporal things insofar as her own mission requires it. She, for her part, does 
not place her trust in the privileges offered by civil authority. She will even 
give up the exercise of certain rights which have been legitimately acquired, if 
it becomes clear that their use will cast doubt on the sincerity of her witness 
or that new ways of life demand new methods. It is only right, however, that at 
all times and in all places, the Church should have true freedom to preach the 
faith, to teach her social doctrine, to exercise her role freely among men, and 
also to pass moral judgment in those matters which regard public order when the 
fundamental rights of a person or the salvation of souls require it. In this, 
she should make use of all the means&#8212;but only those&#8212;which accord with the Gospel 
and which correspond to the general good according to the diversity of times and 
circumstances.</P>
<P>While faithfully adhering to the Gospel and fulfilling her mission to the 
world, the Church, whose duty it is to foster and elevate(9) all that is found 
to be true, good and beautiful in the human community, strengthens peace among 
men for the glory of God.(10)  </P>

<P><B>THE FOSTERING OF PEACE AND THE PROMOTION OF A COMMUNITY OF NATIONS </B></P></CENTER>
<P>77. In our generation when men continue to be afflicted by acute hardships 
and anxieties arising from the ravages of war or the threat of it, the whole 
human family faces an hour of supreme crisis in its advance toward maturity. 
Moving gradually together and everywhere more conscious already of its unity, 
this family cannot accomplish its task of constructing for all men everywhere a 
world more genuinely human unless each person devotes himself to the cause of 
peace with renewed vigor. Thus it happens that the Gospel message, which is in 
harmony with the loftier strivings and aspirations of the human race, takes on a 
new luster in our day as it declares that the artisans of peace are blessed 
&quot;because they will be called the sons of God&quot; (Matt. 5:9).</P>
<P>Consequently, as it points out the authentic and noble meaning of peace and 
condemns the frightfulness of war, the Council wishes passionately to summon 
Christians to cooperate, under the help of Christ the author of peace, with all 
men in securing among themselves a peace based on justice and love and in 
setting up the instruments of peace.</P>
<P>78. Peace is not merely the absence of war; nor can it be reduced solely to 
the maintenance of a balance of power between enemies; nor is it brought about 
by dictatorship. Instead, it is rightly and appropriately called an enterprise of 
justice. Peace results from that order structured into human society by its 
divine Founder, and actualized by men as they thirst after ever greater justice. 
The common good of humanity finds its ultimate meaning in the eternal law. But 
since the concrete demands of this common good are constantly changing as time 
goes on, peace is never attained once and for all, but must be built up 
ceaselessly. Moreover, since the human will is unsteady and wounded by sin, the 
achievement of peace requires a constant mastering of passions and the vigilance 
of lawful authority.</P>
<P>But this is not enough. This peace on earth cannot be obtained unless 
personal well-being is safeguarded and men freely and trustingly share with one 
another the riches of their inner spirits and their talents. A firm 
determination to respect other men and peoples and their dignity, as well as the 
studied practice of brotherhood are absolutely necessary for the establishment 
of peace. Hence peace is likewise the fruit of love, which goes beyond what 
justice can provide.</P>
<P>That earthly peace which arises from love of neighbor symbolizes and results 
from the peace of Christ which radiates from God the Father. For by the cross 
the incarnate Son, the prince of peace reconciled all men with God. By thus 
restoring all men to the unity of one people and one body, He slew hatred in His 
own flesh; and, after being lifted on high by His resurrection, He poured forth 
the spirit of love into the hearts of men.</P>
<P>For this reason, all Christians are urgently summoned to do in love what the 
truth requires, and to join with all true peacemakers in pleading for peace and 
bringing it about.</P>
<P>Motivated by this same spirit, we cannot fail to praise those who renounce 
the use of violence in the vindication of their rights and who resort to methods 
of defense which are otherwise available to weaker parties too, provided this 
can be done without injury to the rights and duties of others or of the 
community itself.</P>
<P>Insofar as men are sinful, the threat of war hangs over them, and hang over 
them it will until the return of Christ. But insofar as men vanquish sin by a 
union of love, they will vanquish violence as well and make these words come 
true: &quot;They shall turn their swords into plough-shares, and their spears into 
sickles. Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn 
war any more&quot; (Isaiah 2:4).  </P>
<P><B>SECTION 1  <BR>The Avoidance of War </B></P>
<P>79. Even though recent wars have wrought physical and moral havoc on our 
world, the devastation of battle still goes on day by day in some part of the 
world. Indeed, now that every kind of weapon produced by modern science is used 
in war, the fierce character of warfare threatens to lead the combatants to a 
savagery far surpassing that of the past. Furthermore, the complexity of the 
modern world and the intricacy of international relations allow guerrilla 
warfare to be drawn out by new methods of deceit and subversion. In many causes 
the use of terrorism is regarded as a new way to wage war.</P>
<P>Contemplating this melancholy state of humanity, the council wishes, above 
all things else, to recall the permanent binding force of universal natural law 
and its all-embracing principles. Man's conscience itself gives ever more 
emphatic voice to these principles. Therefore, actions which deliberately 
conflict with these same principles, as well as orders commanding such actions 
are criminal, and blind obedience cannot excuse those who yield to them. The 
most infamous among these are actions designed for the methodical extermination 
of an entire people, nation or ethnic minority. Such actions must be vehemently 
condemned as horrendous crimes. The courage of those who fearlessly and openly 
resist those who issue such commands merits supreme commendation.</P>
<P>On the subject of war, quite a large number of nations have subscribed to 
international agreements aimed at making military activity and its consequences 
less inhuman. Their stipulations deal with such matters as the treatment of 
wounded soldiers and prisoners. Agreements of this sort must be honored. Indeed 
they should be improved upon so that the frightfulness of war can be better and 
more workably held in check. All men, especially government officials and 
experts in these matters, are bound to do everything they can to effect these 
improvements. Moreover, it seems right that laws make humane provisions for the 
case of those who for reasons of conscience refuse to bear arms, provided 
however, that they agree to serve the human community in some other way.</P>
<P>Certainly, war has not been rooted out of human affairs. As long as the 
danger of war remains and there is no competent and sufficiently powerful 
authority at the international level, governments cannot be denied the right to 
legitimate defense once every means of peaceful settlement has been exhausted. 
State authorities and others who share public responsibility have the duty to 
conduct such grave matters soberly and to protect the welfare of the people 
entrusted to their care. But it is one thing to undertake military action for 
the just defense of the people, and something else again to seek the subjugation 
of other nations. Nor, by the same token, does the mere fact that war has 
unhappily begun mean that all is fair between the warring parties.</P>
<P>Those too who devote themselves to the military service of their country 
should regard themselves as the agents of security and freedom of peoples. As 
long as they fulfill this role properly, they are making a genuine contribution 
to the establishment of peace.</P>
<P>80. The horror and perversity of war is immensely magnified by the addition 
of scientific weapons. For acts of war involving these weapons can inflict 
massive and indiscriminate destruction, thus going far beyond the bounds of 
legitimate defense. Indeed, if the kind of instruments which can now be found in 
the armories of the great nations were to be employed to their fullest, an 
almost total and altogether reciprocal slaughter of each side by the other would 
follow, not to mention the widespread devastation that would take place in the 
world and the deadly after effects that would be spawned by the use of weapons 
of this kind.</P>
<P>All these considerations compel us to undertake an evaluation of war with an 
entirely new attitude.(1) The men of our time must realize that they will have 
to give a somber reckoning of their deeds of war for the course of the future 
will depend greatly on the decisions they make today.</P>
<P>With these truths in mind, this most holy synod makes its own the 
condemnations of total war already pronounced by recent popes,(2) and issues the 
following declaration.</P>
<P>Any act of war aimed indiscriminately at the destruction of entire cities of 
extensive areas along with their population is a crime against God and man 
himself. It merits unequivocal and unhesitating condemnation.</P>
<P>The unique hazard of modern warfare consists in this: it provides those who 
possess modern scientific weapons with a kind of occasion for perpetrating just 
such abominations; moreover, through a certain inexorable chain of events, it 
can catapult men into the most atrocious decisions. That such may never truly 
happen in the future, the bishops of the whole world gathered together, beg all 
men, especially government officials and military leaders, to give unremitting 
thought to their gigantic responsibility before God and the entire human race.</P>
<P>81. To be sure, scientific weapons are not amassed solely for use in war. 
Since the defensive strength of any nation is considered to be dependent upon 
its capacity for immediate retaliation, this accumulation of arms, which 
increases each year, likewise serves, in a way heretofore unknown, as deterrent 
to possible enemy attack. Many regard this procedure as the most effective way 
by which peace of a sort can be maintained between nations at the present time.</P>
<P>Whatever be the facts about this method of deterrence, men should be 
convinced that the arms race in which an already considerable number of 
countries are engaged is not a safe way to preserve a steady peace, nor is the 
so-called balance resulting from this race a sure and authentic peace. Rather 
than being eliminated thereby, the causes of war are in danger of being 
gradually aggravated. While extravagant sums are being spent for the furnishing 
of ever new weapons, an adequate remedy cannot be provided for the multiple 
miseries afflicting the whole modern world. Disagreements between nations are 
not really and radically healed; on the contrary, they spread the infection to 
other parts of the earth. New approaches based on reformed attitudes must be 
taken to remove this trap and to emancipate the world from its crushing anxiety 
through the restoration of genuine peace.</P>
<P>Therefore, we say it again: the arms race is an utterly treacherous trap for 
humanity, and one which ensnares the poor to an intolerable degree. It is much 
to be feared that if this race persists, it will eventually spawn all the lethal 
ruin whose path it is now making ready. Warned by the calamities which the human 
race has made possible, let us make use of the interlude granted us from above 
and for which we are thankful to become more conscious of our own responsibility 
and to find means for resolving our disputes in a manner more worthy of man. 
Divine Providence urgently demands of us that we free ourselves from the age-old 
slavery of war. If we refuse to make this effort, we do not know where we will 
be led by the evil road we have set upon.</P>
<P>It is our clear duty, therefore, to strain every muscle in working for the 
time when all war can be completely outlawed by international consent. This goal 
undoubtedly requires the establishment of some universal public authority 
acknowledged as such by all and endowed with the power to safeguard on the 
behalf of all, security, regard for justice, and respect for rights. But before 
this hoped for authority can be set up, the highest existing international 
centers must devote themselves vigorously to the pursuit of better means for 
obtaining common security. Since peace must be born of mutual trust between 
nations and not be imposed on them through a fear of the available weapons, 
everyone must labor to put an end at last to the arms race, and to make a true 
beginning of disarmament, not unilaterally indeed, but proceeding at an equal 
pace according to agreement, and backed up by true and workable safeguards.(3)</P>
<P>82. In the meantime, efforts which have already been made and are still 
underway to eliminate the danger of war are not to be underrated. On the 
contrary, support should be given to the good will of the very many leaders who 
work hard to do away with war, which they abominate. These men, although 
burdened by the extremely weighty preoccupations of their high office, are 
nonetheless moved by the very grave peacemaking task to which they are bound, 
even if they cannot ignore the complexity of matters as they stand. We should 
fervently ask God to give these men the strength to go forward perseveringly and 
to follow through courageously on this work of building peace with vigor. It is 
a work of supreme love for mankind. Today it certainly demands that they extend 
their thoughts and their spirit beyond the confines of their own nation, that 
they put aside national selfishness and ambition to dominate other nations, and 
that they nourish a profound reverence for the whole of humanity, which is 
already making its way so laboriously toward greater unity.</P>
<P>The problems of peace and of disarmament have already been the subject of 
extensive, strenuous and constant examination. Together with international 
meetings dealing with these problems, such studies should be regarded as the 
first steps toward solving these serious questions, and should be promoted with 
even greater urgency by way of yielding concrete results in the future.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, men should take heed not to entrust themselves only to the 
efforts of some, while not caring about their own attitudes. For government 
officials who must at one and the same time guarantee the good of their own 
people and promote the universal good are very greatly dependent on public 
opinion and feeling. It does them no good to work for peace as long as feelings 
of hostility, contempt and distrust, as well as racial hatred and unbending 
ideologies, continue to divide men and place them in opposing camps. 
Consequently there is above all a pressing need for a renewed education of 
attitudes and for new inspiration in public opinion. Those who are dedicated to 
the work of education, particularly of the young, or who mold public opinion, 
should consider it their most weighty task to instruct all in fresh sentiments 
of peace. Indeed, we all need a change of heart as we regard the entire world 
and those tasks which we can perform in unison for the betterment of our race.</P>
<P>But we should not let false hope deceive us. For unless enmities and hatred 
are put away and firm, honest agreements concerning world peace are reached in 
the future, humanity, which already is in the middle of a grave crisis, even 
though it is endowed with remarkable knowledge, will perhaps be brought to that 
dismal hour in which it will experience no peace other than the dreadful peace 
of death. But, while we say this, the Church of Christ, present in the midst of 
the anxiety of this age, does not cease to hope most firmly. She intends to 
propose to our age over and over again, in season and out of season, this 
apostolic message: &quot;Behold, now is the acceptable time for a change of heart; 
behold! now is the day of salvation.&quot;(4)  </P>
<P><B>SECTION II   <BR>Setting Up An International Community </B></P>
<P>83. In order to build up peace above all the causes of discord among men, 
especially injustice, which foment wars must be rooted out. Not a few of these 
causes come from excessive economic inequalities and from putting off the steps 
needed to remedy them. Other causes of discord, however, have their source in 
the desire to dominate and in a contempt for persons. And, if we look for deeper 
causes, we find them in human envy, distrust, pride, and other egotistical 
passions. Man cannot bear so many ruptures in the harmony of things. 
Consequently, the world is constantly beset by strife and violence between men, 
even when no war is being waged. Besides, since these same evils are present in 
the relations between various nations as well, in order to overcome or forestall 
them and to keep violence once unleashed within limits it is absolutely 
necessary for countries to cooperate more advantageously and more closely 
together and to organize together international bodies and to work tirelessly 
for the creation of organizations which will foster peace.</P>
<P>84. In view of the increasingly close ties of mutual dependence today between 
all the inhabitants and peoples of the earth, the apt pursuit and efficacious 
attainment of the universal common good now require of the community of nations 
that it organize itself in a manner suited to its present responsibilities, 
especially toward the many parts of the world which are still suffering from 
unbearable want.</P>
<P>To reach this goal, organizations of the international community, for their 
part, must make provision for men's different needs, both in the fields of 
social life&#8212;such as food supplies, health, education, labor and also in certain 
special circumstances which can crop up here and there, e.g., the need to 
promote the general improvement of developing countries, or to alleviate the 
distressing conditions in which refugees dispersed throughout the world find 
themselves, or also to assist migrants and their families.</P>
<P>Already existing international and regional organizations are certainly 
well-deserving of the human race. These are the first efforts at laying the 
foundations on an international level for a community of all men to work for the 
solution to the serious problems of our times, to encourage progress everywhere, 
and to obviate wars of whatever kind. In all of these activities the Church 
takes joy in the spirit of true brotherhood flourishing between Christians and 
non-Christians as it strives to make ever more strenuous efforts to relieve 
abundant misery.</P>
<P>85. The present solidarity of mankind also calls for a revival of greater 
international cooperation in the economic field. Although nearly all peoples 
have become autonomous, they are far from being free of every form of undue 
dependence, and far from escaping all danger of serious internal difficulties.</P>
<P>The development of a nation depends on human and financial aids. The citizens 
of each country must be prepared by education and professional training to 
discharge the various tasks of economic and social life. But this in turn 
requires the aid of foreign specialists who, when they give aid, will not act as 
overlords, but as helpers and fellow-workers. Developing nations will not be 
able to procure material assistance unless radical changes are made in the 
established procedures of modern world commerce. Other aid should be provided as 
well by advanced nations in the form of gifts, loans or financial investments. 
Such help should be accorded with generosity and without greed on the one side, 
and received with complete honesty on the other side.</P>
<P>If an authentic economic order is to be established on a world-wide basis, an 
end will have to be put to profiteering, to national ambitions, to the appetite 
for political supremacy, to militaristic calculations, and to machinations for 
the sake of spreading and imposing ideologies.</P>
<P>86. The following norms seem useful for such cooperation:</P>
<P>a) Developing nations should take great pains to seek as the object for 
progress to express and secure the total human fulfillment of their citizens. 
They should bear in mind that progress arises and grows above all out of the 
labor and genius of the nations themselves because it has to be based, not only 
on foreign aid, but especially on the full utilization of their own resources, 
and on the development of their own culture and traditions. Those who exert the 
greatest influence on others should be outstanding in this respect.</P>
<P>b) On the other hand, it is a very important duty of the advanced nations to 
help the developing nations in discharging their above-mentioned 
responsibilities. They should therefore gladly carry out on their own home front 
those spiritual and material readjustments that are required for the realization 
of this universal cooperation.</P>
<P>Consequently, in business dealings with weaker and poorer nations, they 
should be careful to respect their profit, for these countries need the income 
they receive on the sale of their homemade products to support themselves.</P>
<P>c) It is the role of the international community to coordinate and promote 
development, but in such a way that the resources earmarked for this purpose 
will be allocated as effectively as possible, and with complete equity. It is 
likewise this community's duty, with due regard for the principle of 
subsidiarity, so to regulate economic relations throughout the world that these 
will be carried out in accordance with the norms of justice.</P>
<P>Suitable organizations should be set up to foster and regulate international 
business affairs, particularly with the underdeveloped countries, and to 
compensate for losses resulting from an excessive inequality of power among the 
various nations. This type of organization, in unison with technical cultural 
and financial aid, should provide the help which developing nations need so that 
they can advantageously pursue their own economic advancement.</P>
<P>d) In many cases there is an urgent need to revamp economic and social 
structures. But one must guard against proposals of technical solutions that are 
untimely. This is particularly true of those solutions providing man with 
material conveniences, but nevertheless contrary to man's spiritual nature and 
advancement. For &quot;not by bread alone does man live, but by every word which 
proceeds from the mouth of God&quot; (Matt. 4:4). Every sector of the family of man 
carries within itself and in its best traditions some portion of the spiritual 
treasure entrusted by God to humanity, even though many may not be aware of the 
source from which it comes.</P>
<P>87. International cooperation is needed today especially for those peoples 
who, besides facing so many other difficulties, likewise undergo pressures due 
to a rapid increase in population. There is an urgent need to explore, with the 
full and intense cooperation of all, and especially of the wealthier nations, 
ways whereby the human necessities of food and a suitable education can be 
furnished and shared with the entire human community. But some peoples could 
greatly improve upon the conditions of their life if they would change over from 
antiquated methods of farming to the new technical methods, applying them with 
needed prudence according to their own circumstances. Their life would likewise 
be improved by the establishment of a better social order and by a fairer system 
for the distribution of land ownership.</P>
<P>Governments undoubtedly have rights and duties, within the limits of their 
proper competency, regarding the population problem in their respective 
countries, for instance, in the line of social and family life legislation, or 
regarding the migration of country-dwellers to the cities, or with respect to 
information concerning the condition and needs of the country. Since men today 
are giving thought to this problem and are so greatly disturbed over it, it is 
desirable in addition that Catholic specialists, especially in the universities, 
skillfully pursue and develop studies and projects on all these matters.</P>
<P>But there are many today who maintain that the increase in world population, 
or at least the population increase in some countries, must be radically curbed 
by every means possible and by any kind of intervention on the part of public 
authority. In view of this contention, the council urges everyone to guard 
against solutions, whether publicly or privately supported, or at times even 
imposed, which are contrary to the moral law. For in keeping with man's 
inalienable right to marry and generate children, a decision concerning the 
number of children they will have depends on the right judgment of the parents 
and it cannot in any way be left to the judgment of public authority. But since 
the judgment of the parents presupposes a rightly formed conscience, it is of 
the utmost importance that the way be open for everyone to develop a correct and 
genuinely human responsibility which respects the divine law and takes into 
consideration the circumstances of the situation and the time. But sometimes 
this requires an improvement in educational and social conditions, and, above 
all, formation in religion or at least a complete moral training. Men should 
discreetly be informed, furthermore, of scientific advances in exploring methods 
whereby spouses can be helped in regulating the number of their children and 
whose safeness has been well proven and whose harmony with the moral order has 
been ascertained.</P>
<P>88. Christians should cooperate willingly and wholeheartedly in establishing 
an international order that includes a genuine respect for all freedoms and 
amicable brotherhood between all. This is all the more pressing since the 
greater part of the world is still suffering from so much poverty that it is as 
if Christ Himself were crying out in these poor to beg the charity of the 
disciples. Do not let men, then, be scandalized because some countries with a 
majority of citizens who are counted as Christians have an abundance of wealth, 
whereas others are deprived of the necessities of life and are tormented with 
hunger, disease, and every kind of misery. The spirit of poverty and charity are 
the glory and witness of the Church of Christ.</P>
<P>Those Christians are to be praised and supported, therefore, who volunteer 
their services to help other men and nations. Indeed, it is the duty of the 
whole People of God, following the word and example of the bishops, to alleviate 
as far as they are able the sufferings of the modern age. They should do this 
too, as was the ancient custom in the Church, out of the substance of their 
goods, and not only out of what is superfluous.</P>
<P>The procedure of collecting and distributing aids, without being inflexible 
and completely uniform, should nevertheless be carried on in an orderly fashion 
in dioceses, nations, and throughout the entire world. Wherever it seems 
convenient, this activity of Catholics should be carried on in unison with other 
Christian brothers. For the spirit of charity does not forbid, but on the 
contrary commands that charitable activity be carried out in a careful and 
orderly manner. Therefore, it is essential for those who intend to dedicate 
themselves to the services of the developing nations to be properly trained in 
appropriate institutes.</P>
<P>89. Since, in virtue of her mission received from God, the Church preaches 
the Gospel to all men and dispenses the treasures of grace, she contributes to 
the ensuring of peace everywhere on earth and to the placing of the fraternal 
exchange between men on solid ground by imparting knowledge of the divine and 
natural law. Therefore, to encourage and stimulate cooperation among men, the 
Church must be clearly present in the midst of the community of nations both 
through her official channels and through the full and sincere collaboration of 
all Christians&#8212;a collaboration motivated solely by the desire to be of service 
to all.</P>
<P>This will come about more effectively if the faithful themselves, conscious 
of their responsibility as men and as Christians will exert their influence in 
their own milieu to arouse a ready willingness to cooperate with the 
international community. Special care must be given, in both religious and civil 
education, to the formation of youth in this regard.</P>
<P>90. An outstanding form of international activity on the part of Christians 
is found in the joint efforts which, both as individuals and in groups, they 
contribute to institutes already established or to be established for the 
encouragement of cooperation among nations. There are also various Catholic 
associations on an international level which can contribute in many ways to the 
building up of a peaceful and fraternal community of nations. These should be 
strengthened by augmenting in them the number of well qualified collaborators, 
by increasing needed resources, and by advantageously fortifying the 
coordination of their energies. For today both effective action and the need for 
dialogue demand joint projects. Moreover, such associations contribute much to 
the development of a universal outlook&#8212;something certainly appropriate for 
Catholics. They also help to form an awareness of genuine universal solidarity 
and responsibility.</P>
<P>Finally, it is very much to be desired that Catholics, in order to fulfill 
their role properly in the international community, will seek to cooperate 
actively and in a positive manner both with their separated brothers who 
together with them profess the Gospel of charity and with all men thirsting for 
true peace.</P>
<P>The council, considering the immensity of the hardships which still afflict 
the greater part of mankind today, regards it as most opportune that an organism 
of the universal Church be set up in order that both the justice and love of 
Christ toward the poor might be developed everywhere. The role of such an 
organism would be to stimulate the Catholic community to promote progress in 
needy regions and international social justice.</P>
<P>91. Drawn from the treasures of Church teaching, the proposals of this sacred 
synod look to the assistance of every man of our time, whether he believes in 
God, or does not explicitly recognize Him. If adopted, they will promote among 
men a sharper insight into their full destiny, and thereby lead them to fashion 
the world more to man's surpassing dignity, to search for a brotherhood which is 
universal and more deeply rooted, and to meet the urgencies of our ages with a 
gallant and unified effort born of love.</P>
<P>Undeniably this conciliar program is but a general one in several of its 
parts; and deliberately so, given the immense variety of situations and forms of 
human culture in the world. Indeed while it presents teaching already accepted 
in the Church, the program will have to be followed up and amplified since it 
sometimes deals with matters in a constant state of development. Still, we have 
relied on the word of God and the spirit of the Gospel. Hence we entertain the 
hope that many of our proposals will prove to be of substantial benefit to 
everyone, especially after they have been adapted to individual nations and 
mentalities by the faithful, under the guidance of their pastors.</P>
<P>92. By virtue of her mission to shed on the whole world the radiance of the 
Gospel message, and to unify under one Spirit all men of whatever nation, race 
or culture, the Church stands forth as a sign of that brotherhood which allows 
honest dialogue and gives it vigor.</P>
<P>Such a mission requires in the first place that we foster within the Church 
herself mutual esteem, reverence and harmony, through the full recognition of 
lawful diversity. Thus all those who compose the one People of God, both pastors 
and the general faithful, can engage in dialogue with ever abounding 
fruitfulness. For the bonds which unite the faithful are mightier than anything 
dividing them. Hence, let there be unity in what is necessary; freedom in what 
is unsettled, and charity in any case.</P>
<P>Our hearts embrace also those brothers and communities not yet living with us 
in full communion; to them we are linked nonetheless by our profession of the 
Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, and by the bond of charity. We do not 
forget that the unity of Christians is today awaited and desired by many, too, 
who do not believe in Christ; for the farther it advances toward truth and love 
under the powerful impulse of the Holy Spirit, the more this unity will be a 
harbinger of unity and peace for the world at large. Therefore, by common effort 
and in ways which are today increasingly appropriate for seeking this splendid 
goal effectively, let us take pains to pattern ourselves after the Gospel more 
exactly every day, and thus work as brothers in rendering service to the human 
family. For, in Christ Jesus this family is called to the family of the sons of 
God.</P>
<P>We think cordially too of all who acknowledge God, and who preserve in their 
traditions precious elements of religion and humanity. We want frank 
conversation to compel us all to receive the impulses of the Spirit faithfully 
and to act on them energetically.</P>
<P>For our part, the desire for such dialogue, which can lead to truth through 
love alone, excludes no one, though an appropriate measure of prudence must 
undoubtedly be exercised. We include those who cultivate outstanding qualities 
of the human spirit, but do not yet acknowledge the Source of these qualities. 
We include those who oppress the Church and harass her in manifold ways. Since 
God the Father is the origin and purpose of all men, we are all called to be 
brothers. Therefore, if we have been summoned to the same destiny, human and 
divine, we can and we should work together without violence and deceit in order 
to build up the world in genuine peace.</P>
<P>93. Mindful of the Lord's saying: &quot;by this will all men know that you are my 
disciples, if you have love for one another&quot; (John 13:35), Christians cannot 
yearn for anything more ardently than to serve the men of the modern world with 
mounting generosity and success. Therefore, by holding faithfully to the Gospel 
and benefiting from its resources, by joining with every man who loves and 
practices justice, Christians have shouldered a gigantic task for fulfillment in 
this world, a task concerning which they must give a reckoning to Him who 
will judge every man on the last of days.</P>
<P>Not everyone who cries, &quot;Lord, Lord,&quot; will enter into the kingdom of heaven, 
but those who do the Father's will by taking a strong grip on the work at hand. 
Now, the Father wills that in all men we recognize Christ our brother and love 
Him effectively, in word and in deed. By thus giving witness to the truth, we 
will share with others the mystery of the heavenly Father's love. As a 
consequence, men throughout the world will be aroused to a lively hope&#8212;the gift 
of the Holy Spirit&#8212;that some day at last they will be caught up in peace and 
utter happiness in that fatherland radiant with the glory of the Lord.</P>
<P>Now to Him who is able to accomplish all things in a measure far beyond what 
we ask or conceive, in keeping with the power that is at work in us&#8212;to Him be 
glory in the Church and in Christ Jesus, down through all the ages of time 
without end. Amen. (Eph. 3:20-21).</P>

<P>Preface</P>
<P>1. The Pastoral Constitution &quot;De Ecclesia in Mundo Huius Temporis&quot; is made up 
of two parts; yet it constitutes an organic unity. By way of explanation: the 
constitution is called &quot;pastoral&quot; because, while resting on doctrinal 
principles, it seeks to express the relation of the Church to the world and 
modern mankind. The result is that, on the one hand, a pastoral slant is present 
in the first part, and, on the other hand, a doctrinal slant is present in the 
second part. In the first part, the Church develops her teaching on man, on the 
world which is the enveloping context of man's existence, and on man's relations 
to his fellow men. In part two, the Church gives closer consideration to various 
aspects of modern life and human society; special consideration is given to 
those questions and problems which, in this general area, seem to have a greater 
urgency in our day. As a result in part two the subject matter which is viewed 
in the light of doctrinal principles is made up of diverse elements. Some 
elements have a permanent value; others, only a transitory one. Consequently, 
the constitution must be interpreted according to the general norms of 
theological interpretation. Interpreters must bear in mind&#8212;especially in part 
two&#8212;the changeable circumstances which the subject matter, by its very nature, 
involves.</P>

Sept. 11, 1962: AAS 54 (1962) p. 682: &quot;The obligation of every man, the urgent 
obligation of the Christian man, is to reckon what is superfluous by the measure 
of the needs of others, and to see to it that the administration and the 
distribution of created goods serve the common good.&quot;</P>
<P>11. In that case, the old principle holds true: &quot;In extreme necessity all 
goods are common, that is, all goods are to be shared.&quot; On the other hand, for 
the order, extension, and manner by which the principle is applied in the 
proposed text, besides the modern authors: cf. St. Thomas, <i>Summa Theologica</i> 
II-II, q. 66, a. 7. Obviously, for the correct application of the principle, all 
the conditions that are morally required must be met.</P>
