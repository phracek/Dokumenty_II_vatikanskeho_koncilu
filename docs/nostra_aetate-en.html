PAUL VI<BR>ON OCTOBER 28, 1965</font></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" size=3><P>&nbsp;</P></CENTER>
<P>1. In our time, when day by day mankind is being drawn closer together, and 
the ties between different peoples are becoming stronger, the Church examines 
more closely her relationship to non-Christian religions. In her task of 
promoting unity and love among men, indeed among nations, she considers above 
all in this declaration what men have in common and what draws them to 
fellowship.     </P>
<P>One is the community of all peoples, one their origin, for God made the whole 
human race to live over the face of the earth.(1) One also is their final goal, 
God. His providence, His manifestations of goodness, His saving design extend to 
all men,(2) until that time when the elect will be united in the Holy City, the 
city ablaze with the glory of God, where the nations will walk in His light.(3)     </P>
<P>Men expect from the various religions answers to the unsolved riddles of the 
human condition, which today, even as in former times, deeply stir the hearts of 
men: What is man? What is the meaning, the aim of our life? What is moral good, 
what is sin? Whence suffering and what purpose does it serve? Which is the road to 
true happiness? What are death, judgment and retribution after death? What, 
finally, is that ultimate inexpressible mystery which encompasses our existence: 
whence do we come, and where are we going?      </P>
<P>2. From ancient times down to the present, there is found among various 
peoples a certain perception of that hidden power which hovers over the course 
of things and over the events of human history; at times some indeed have come 
to the recognition of a Supreme Being, or even of a Father. This perception and 
recognition penetrates their lives with a profound religious sense.   </P>
<P>  Religions, however, that are bound up with an advanced culture have 
struggled to answer the same questions by means of more refined concepts and a 
more developed language. Thus in Hinduism, men contemplate the divine mystery 
and express it through an inexhaustible abundance of myths and through searching 
philosophical inquiry. They seek freedom from the anguish of our human condition 
either through ascetical practices or profound meditation or a flight to God 
with love and trust. Again, Buddhism, in its various forms, realizes the radical 
insufficiency of this changeable world; it teaches a way by which men, in a 
devout and confident spirit, may be able either to acquire the state of perfect 
liberation, or attain, by their own efforts or through higher help, supreme 
illumination. Likewise, other religions found everywhere try to counter the 
restlessness of the human heart, each in its own manner, by proposing &quot;ways,&quot; 
comprising teachings, rules of life, and sacred rites. The Catholic Church 
rejects nothing that is true and holy in these religions. She regards with 
sincere reverence those ways of conduct and of life, those precepts and 
teachings which, though differing in many aspects from the ones she holds and 
sets forth, nonetheless often reflect a ray of that Truth which enlightens all 
men. Indeed, she proclaims, and ever must proclaim Christ &quot;the way, the truth, 
and the life&quot; (John 14:6), in whom men may find the fullness of religious life, 
in whom God has reconciled all things to Himself.(4)    </P>
<P> The Church, therefore, exhorts her sons, that through dialogue and 
collaboration with the followers of other religions, carried out with prudence 
and love and in witness to the Christian faith and life, they recognize, 
preserve and promote the good things, spiritual and moral, as well as the 
socio-cultural values found among these men.     </P>
<P>3. The Church regards with esteem also the Moslems. They adore the one God, 
living and subsisting in Himself; merciful and all- powerful, the Creator of 
heaven and earth,(5) who has spoken to men; they take pains to submit 
wholeheartedly to even His inscrutable decrees, just as Abraham, with whom the 
faith of Islam takes pleasure in linking itself, submitted to God. Though they 
do not acknowledge Jesus as God, they revere Him as a prophet. They also honor 
Mary, His virgin Mother; at times they even call on her with devotion. In 
addition, they await the day of judgment when God will render their deserts to 
all those who have been raised up from the dead. Finally, they value the moral 
life and worship God especially through prayer, almsgiving and fasting.     </P>
<P>Since in the course of centuries not a few quarrels and hostilities have 
arisen between Christians and Moslems, this sacred synod urges all to forget the 
past and to work sincerely for mutual understanding and to preserve as well as 
to promote together for the benefit of all mankind social justice and moral 
welfare, as well as peace and freedom.     </P>
<P>4. As the sacred synod searches into the mystery of the Church, it remembers 
the bond that spiritually ties the people of the New Covenant to Abraham's 
stock.    </P>
<P> Thus the Church of Christ acknowledges that, according to God's saving 
design, the beginnings of her faith and her election are found already among the 
Patriarchs, Moses and the prophets. She professes that all who believe in 
Christ-Abraham's sons according to faith (6)-are included in the same 
Patriarch's call, and likewise that the salvation of the Church is mysteriously 
foreshadowed by the chosen people's exodus from the land of bondage. The Church, 
therefore, cannot forget that she received the revelation of the Old Testament 
through the people with whom God in His inexpressible mercy concluded the 
Ancient Covenant. Nor can she forget that she draws sustenance from the root of 
that well-cultivated olive tree onto which have been grafted the wild shoots, 
the Gentiles.(7) Indeed, the Church believes that by His cross Christ, Our 
Peace, reconciled Jews and Gentiles. making both one in Himself.(8)     </P>
<P>The Church keeps ever in mind the words of the Apostle about his kinsmen: 
&quot;theirs is the sonship and the glory and the covenants and the law and the 
worship and the promises; theirs are the fathers and from them is the Christ 
according to the flesh&quot; (Rom. 9:4-5), the Son of the Virgin Mary. She also 
recalls that the Apostles, the Church's main-stay and pillars, as well as most 
of the early disciples who proclaimed Christ's Gospel to the world, sprang from 
the Jewish people.     </P>
<P>As Holy Scripture testifies, Jerusalem did not recognize the time of her 
visitation,(9) nor did the Jews in large number, accept the Gospel; indeed not a 
few opposed its spreading.(10) Nevertheless, God holds the Jews most dear for 
the sake of their Fathers; He does not repent of the gifts He makes or of the 
calls He issues-such is the witness of the Apostle.(11) In company with the 
Prophets and the same Apostle, the Church awaits that day, known to God alone, 
on which all peoples will address the Lord in a single voice and &quot;serve him 
shoulder to shoulder&quot; (Soph. 3:9).(12)     </P>
<P>Since the spiritual patrimony common to Christians and Jews is thus so great, 
this sacred synod wants to foster and recommend that mutual understanding and 
respect which is the fruit, above all, of biblical and theological studies as 
well as of fraternal dialogues.    </P>
<P> True, the Jewish authorities and those who followed their lead pressed for 
the death of Christ;(13) still, what happened in His passion cannot be charged 
against all the Jews, without distinction, then alive, nor against the Jews of 
today. Although the Church is the new people of God, the Jews should not be 
presented as rejected or accursed by God, as if this followed from the Holy 
Scriptures. All should see to it, then, that in catechetical work or in the 
preaching of the word of God they do not teach anything that does not conform to 
the truth of the Gospel and the spirit of Christ.     </P>
<P>Furthermore, in her rejection of every persecution against any man, the 
Church, mindful of the patrimony she shares with the Jews and moved not by 
political reasons but by the Gospel's spiritual love, decries hatred, 
persecutions, displays of anti-Semitism, directed against Jews at any time and 
by anyone.     </P>
<P>Besides, as the Church has always held and holds now, Christ underwent His 
passion and death freely, because of the sins of men and out of infinite love, 
in order that all may reach salvation. It is, therefore, the burden of the 
Church's preaching to proclaim the cross of Christ as the sign of God's 
all-embracing love and as the fountain from which every grace flows.     </P>
<P>5. We cannot truly call on God, the Father of all, if we refuse to treat in a 
brotherly way any man, created as he is in the image of God. Man's relation to 
God the Father and his relation to men his brothers are so linked together that 
Scripture says: &quot;He who does not love does not know God&quot; (1 John 4:8).
   </P>
<P> No foundation therefore remains for any theory or practice that leads to 
discrimination between man and man or people and people, so far as their human 
dignity and the rights flowing from it are concerned.     </P>
<P>The Church reproves, as foreign to the mind of Christ, any discrimination 
against men or harassment of them because of their race, color, condition of 
life, or religion. On the contrary, following in the footsteps of the holy 
Apostles Peter and Paul, this sacred synod ardently implores the Christian 
faithful to &quot;maintain good fellowship among the nations&quot; (1 Peter 2:12), and, if 
possible, to live for their part in peace with all men,(14) so that they may 
truly be sons of the Father who is in heaven.(15)  </P>
