<P>1. A sense of the dignity of the human person has been impressing itself more 
and more deeply on the consciousness of contemporary man,(1) and the demand is 
increasingly made that men should act on their own judgment, enjoying and making 
use of a responsible freedom, not driven by coercion but motivated by a sense of 
duty. The demand is likewise made that constitutional limits should be set to 
the powers of government, in order that there may be no encroachment on the 
rightful freedom of the person and of associations. This demand for freedom in 
human society chiefly regards the quest for the values proper to the human 
spirit. It regards, in the first place, the free exercise of religion in 
society. This Vatican Council takes careful note of these desires in the minds 
of men. It proposes to declare them to be greatly in accord with truth and 
justice. To this end, it searches into the sacred tradition and doctrine of the 
Church-the treasury out of which the Church continually brings forth new things 
that are in harmony with the things that are old. </P>
<P>First, the council professes its belief that God Himself has made known to 
mankind the way in which men are to serve Him, and thus be saved in Christ and 
come to blessedness. We believe that this one true religion subsists in the 
Catholic and Apostolic Church, to which the Lord Jesus committed the duty of 
spreading it abroad among all men. Thus He spoke to the Apostles: &quot;Go, 
therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the 
Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all 
things whatsoever I have enjoined upon you&quot; (Matt. 28: 19-20). On their part, 
all men are bound to seek the truth, especially in what concerns God and His 
Church, and to embrace the truth they come to know, and to hold fast to it.</P>
<P>This Vatican Council likewise professes its belief that it is upon the human 
conscience that these obligations fall and exert their binding force. The truth 
cannot impose itself except by virtue of its own truth, as it makes its entrance 
into the mind at once quietly and with power.</P>
<P>Religious freedom, in turn, which men demand as necessary to fulfill their 
duty to worship God, has to do with immunity from coercion in civil society. 
Therefore it leaves untouched traditional Catholic doctrine on the moral duty of 
men and societies toward the true religion and toward the one Church of Christ.</P>
<P>Over and above all this, the council intends to develop the doctrine of 
recent popes on the inviolable rights of the human person and the constitutional 
order of society.</P>
<P>2. This Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to 
religious freedom. This freedom means that all men are to be immune from 
coercion on the part of individuals or of social groups and of any human power, 
in such wise that no one is to be forced to act in a manner contrary to his own 
beliefs, whether privately or publicly, whether alone or in association with 
others, within due limits.</P>
<P>The council further declares that the right to religious freedom has its 
foundation in the very dignity of the human person as this dignity is known 
through the revealed word of God and by reason itself.(2) This right of the 
human person to religious freedom is to be recognized in the constitutional law 
whereby society is governed and thus it is to become a civil right.</P>
<P>It is in accordance with their dignity as persons-that is, beings endowed 
with reason and free will and therefore privileged to bear personal 
responsibility-that all men should be at once impelled by nature and also bound 
by a moral obligation to seek the truth, especially religious truth. They are 
also bound to adhere to the truth, once it is known, and to order their whole 
lives in accord with the demands of truth. However, men cannot discharge these 
obligations in a manner in keeping with their own nature unless they enjoy 
immunity from external coercion as well as psychological freedom. Therefore the 
right to religious freedom has its foundation not in the subjective disposition 
of the person, but in his very nature. In consequence, the right to this 
immunity continues to exist even in those who do not live up to their obligation 
of seeking the truth and adhering to it and the exercise of this right is not to 
be impeded, provided that just public order be observed.</P>
<P>3. Further light is shed on the subject if one considers that the highest 
norm of human life is the divine law-eternal, objective and universal-whereby 
God orders, directs and governs the entire universe and all the ways of the 
human community by a plan conceived in wisdom and love. Man has been made by God 
to participate in this law, with the result that, under the gentle disposition 
of divine Providence, he can come to perceive ever more fully the truth that is 
unchanging. Wherefore every man has the duty, and therefore the right, to seek 
the truth in matters religious in order that he may with prudence form for 
himself right and true judgments of conscience, under use of all suitable means.</P>
<P>Truth, however, is to be sought after in a manner proper to the dignity of 
the human person and his social nature. The inquiry is to be free, carried on 
with the aid of teaching or instruction, communication and dialogue, in the 
course of which men explain to one another the truth they have discovered, or 
think they have discovered, in order thus to assist one another in the quest for 
truth.</P>
<P>Moreover, as the truth is discovered, it is by a personal assent that men are 
to adhere to it.</P>
<P>On his part, man perceives and acknowledges the imperatives of the divine law 
through the mediation of conscience. In all his activity a man is bound to 
follow his conscience in order that he may come to God, the end and purpose of 
life. It follows that he is not to be forced to act in a manner contrary to his 
conscience. Nor, on the other hand, is he to be restrained from acting in 
accordance with his conscience, especially in matters religious. The reason is 
that the exercise of religion, of its very nature, consists before all else in 
those internal, voluntary and free acts whereby man sets the course of his life 
directly toward God. No merely human power can either command or prohibit acts 
of this kind.(3) The social nature of man, however, itself requires that he 
should give external expression to his internal acts of religion: that he should 
share with others in matters religious; that he should profess his religion in 
community. Injury therefore is done to the human person and to the very order 
established by God for human life, if the free exercise of religion is denied in 
society, provided just public order is observed.</P>
<P>There is a further consideration. The religious acts whereby men, in private 
and in public and out of a sense of personal conviction, direct their lives to 
God transcend by their very nature the order of terrestrial and temporal 
affairs. Government therefore ought indeed to take account of the religious life 
of the citizenry and show it favor, since the function of government is to make 
provision for the common welfare. However, it would clearly transgress the 
limits set to its power, were it to presume to command or inhibit acts that are 
religious.</P>
<P>4. The freedom or immunity from coercion in matters religious which is the 
endowment of persons as individuals is also to be recognized as their right when 
they act in community. Religious communities are a requirement of the social 
nature both of man and of religion itself.</P>
<P>Provided the just demands of public order are observed, religious communities 
rightfully claim freedom in order that they may govern themselves according to 
their own norms, honor the Supreme Being in public worship, assist their members 
in the practice of the religious life, strengthen them by instruction, and 
promote institutions in which they may join together for the purpose of ordering 
their own lives in accordance with their religious principles.</P>
<P>Religious communities also have the right not to be hindered, either by legal 
measures or by administrative action on the part of government, in the 
selection, training, appointment, and transferral of their own ministers, in 
communicating with religious authorities and communities abroad, in erecting 
buildings for religious purposes, and in the acquisition and use of suitable 
funds or properties.</P>
<P>Religious communities also have the right not to be hindered in their public 
teaching and witness to their faith, whether by the spoken or by the written 
word. However, in spreading religious faith and in introducing religious 
practices everyone ought at all times to refrain from any manner of action which 
might seem to carry a hint of coercion or of a kind of persuasion that would be 
dishonorable or unworthy, especially when dealing with poor or uneducated 
people. Such a manner of action would have to be considered an abuse of one's 
right and a violation of the right of others. </P>
<P>In addition, it comes within the meaning of religious freedom that religious 
communities should not be prohibited from freely undertaking to show the special 
value of their doctrine in what concerns the organization of society and the 
inspiration of the whole of human activity. Finally, the social nature of man 
and the very nature of religion afford the foundation of the right of men freely 
to hold meetings and to establish educational, cultural, charitable and social 
organizations, under the impulse of their own religious sense.</P>
<P>5. The family, since it is a society in its own original right, has the right 
freely to live its own domestic religious life under the guidance of parents. 
Parents, moreover, have the right to determine, in accordance with their own 
religious beliefs, the kind of religious education that their children are to 
receive. Government, in consequence, must acknowledge the right of parents to 
make a genuinely free choice of schools and of other means of education, and the 
use of this freedom of choice is not to be made a reason for imposing unjust 
burdens on parents, whether directly or indirectly. Besides, the right of 
parents are violated, if their children are forced to attend lessons or 
instructions which are not in agreement with their religious beliefs, or if a 
single system of education, from which all religious formation is excluded, is 
imposed upon all. </P>
<P>6. Since the common welfare of society consists in the entirety of those 
conditions of social life under which men enjoy the possibility of achieving 
their own perfection in a certain fullness of measure and also with some 
relative ease, it chiefly consists in the protection of the rights, and in the 
performance of the duties, of the human person.(4) Therefore the care of the 
right to religious freedom devolves upon the whole citizenry, upon social 
groups, upon government, and upon the Church and other religious communities, in 
virtue of the duty of all toward the common welfare, and in the manner proper to 
each.</P>
<P>The protection and promotion of the inviolable rights of man ranks among the 
essential duties of government.(5) Therefore government is to assume the 
safeguard of the religious freedom of all its citizens, in an effective manner, 
by just laws and by other appropriate means.</P>
<P>Government is also to help create conditions favorable to the fostering of 
religious life, in order that the people may be truly enabled to exercise their 
religious rights and to fulfill their religious duties, and also in order that 
society itself may profit by the moral qualities of justice and peace which have 
their origin in men's faithfulness to God and to His holy will. (6)</P>
<P>If, in view of peculiar circumstances obtaining among peoples, special civil 
recognition is given to one religious community in the constitutional order of 
society, it is at the same time imperative that the right of all citizens and 
religious communities to religious freedom should be recognized and made 
effective in practice.</P>
<P>Finally, government is to see to it that equality of citizens before the law, 
which is itself an element of the common good, is never violated, whether openly 
or covertly, for religious reasons. Nor is there to be discrimination among 
citizens.</P>
<P>It follows that a wrong is done when government imposes upon its people, by 
force or fear or other means, the profession or repudiation of any religion, or 
when it hinders men from joining or leaving a religious community. All the more 
is it a violation of the will of God and of the sacred rights of the person and 
the family of nations when force is brought to bear in any way in order to 
destroy or repress religion, either in the whole of mankind or in a particular 
country or in a definite community.</P>
<P>7. The right to religious freedom is exercised in human society: hence its 
exercise is subject to certain regulatory norms. In the use of all freedoms the 
moral principle of personal and social responsibility is to be observed. In the 
exercise of their rights, individual men and social groups are bound by the 
moral law to have respect both for the rights of others and for their own duties 
toward others and for the common welfare of all. Men are to deal with their 
fellows in justice and civility.</P>
<P>Furthermore, society has the right to defend itself against possible abuses 
committed on the pretext of freedom of religion. It is the special duty of 
government to provide this protection. However, government is not to act in an 
arbitrary fashion or in an unfair spirit of partisanship. Its action is to be 
controlled by juridical norms which are in conformity with the objective moral 
order. These norms arise out of the need for the effective safeguard of the 
rights of all citizens and for the peaceful settlement of conflicts of rights, 
also out of the need for an adequate care of genuine public peace, which comes 
about when men live together in good order and in true justice, and finally out 
of the need for a proper guardianship of public morality. </P>
<P>These matters constitute the basic component of the common welfare: they are 
what is meant by public order. For the rest, the usages of society are to be the 
usages of freedom in their full range: that is, the freedom of man is to be 
respected as far as possible and is not to be curtailed except when and insofar 
as necessary.</P>
<P>8. Many pressures are brought to bear upon the men of our day, to the point 
where the danger arises lest they lose the possibility of acting on their own 
judgment. On the other hand, not a few can be found who seem inclined to use the 
name of freedom as the pretext for refusing to submit to authority and for 
making light of the duty of obedience. Wherefore this Vatican Council urges 
everyone, especially those who are charged with the task of educating others, to 
do their utmost to form men who, on the one hand, will respect the moral order 
and be obedient to lawful authority, and on the other hand, will be lovers of 
true freedom-men, in other words, who will come to decisions on their own 
judgment and in the light of truth, govern their activities with a sense of 
responsibility, and strive after what is true and right, willing always to join 
with others in cooperative effort.</P>
<P>Religious freedom therefore ought to have this further purpose and aim, 
namely, that men may come to act with greater responsibility in fulfilling their 
duties in community life.</P>
<P>9. The declaration of this Vatican Council on the right of man to religious 
freedom has its foundation in the dignity of the person, whose exigencies have 
come to be are fully known to human reason through centuries of experience. What 
is more, this doctrine of freedom has roots in divine revelation, and for this 
reason Christians are bound to respect it all the more conscientiously. 
Revelation does not indeed affirm in so many words the right of man to immunity 
from external coercion in matters religious. It does, however, disclose the 
dignity of the human person in its full dimensions. It gives evidence of the 
respect which Christ showed toward the freedom with which man is to fulfill his 
duty of belief in the word of God and it gives us lessons in the spirit which 
disciples of such a Master ought to adopt and continually follow. Thus further 
light is cast upon the general principles upon which the doctrine of this 
declaration on religious freedom is based. In particular, religious freedom in 
society is entirely consonant with the freedom of the act of Christian faith.</P>
<P>10. It is one of the major tenets of Catholic doctrine that man's response to 
God in faith must be free: no one therefore is to be forced to embrace the 
Christian faith against his own will.(8) This doctrine is contained in the word 
of God and it was constantly proclaimed by the Fathers of the Church.(7) The act 
of faith is of its very nature a free act. Man, redeemed by Christ the Savior 
and through Christ Jesus called to be God's adopted son,(9) cannot give his 
adherence to God revealing Himself unless, under the drawing of the Father,(10) 
he offers to God the reasonable and free submission of faith. It is therefore 
completely in accord with the nature of faith that in matters religious every 
manner of coercion on the part of men should be excluded. In consequence, the 
principle of religious freedom makes no small contribution to the creation of an 
environment in which men can without hindrance be invited to the Christian 
faith, embrace it of their own free will, and profess it effectively in their 
whole manner of life.</P>
<P>11. God calls men to serve Him in spirit and in truth, hence they are bound 
in conscience but they stand under no compulsion. God has regard for the dignity 
of the human person whom He Himself created and man is to be guided by his own 
judgment and he is to enjoy freedom. This truth appears at its height in Christ 
Jesus, in whom God manifested Himself and His ways with men. Christ is at once 
our Master and our Lord(11) and also meek and humble of heart.(12) In attracting 
and inviting His disciples He used patience.(13) He wrought miracles to 
illuminate His teaching and to establish its truth, but His intention was to 
rouse faith in His hearers and to confirm them in faith, not to exert coercion 
upon them.(14) He did indeed denounce the unbelief of some who listened to Him, 
but He left vengeance to God in expectation of the day of judgment.(15) When He 
sent His Apostles into the world, He said to them: &quot;He who believes and is 
baptized will be saved. He who does not believe will be condemned&quot; (Mark 16:16). 
But He Himself, noting that the cockle had been sown amid the wheat, gave orders 
that both should be allowed to grow until the harvest time, which will come at 
the end of the world.(16) He refused to be a political messiah, ruling by 
force:(17) He preferred to call Himself the Son of Man, who came &quot;to serve and 
to give his life as a ransom for the many&quot; (Mark 10:45). He showed Himself the 
perfect servant of God,(18) who &quot;does not break the bruised reed nor extinguish 
the smoking flax&quot; (Matt. 12:20).</P>
<P>He acknowledged the power of government and its rights, when He commanded 
that tribute be given to Caesar: but He gave clear warning that the higher 
rights of God are to be kept inviolate: &quot;Render to Caesar the things that are 
Caesar's and to God the things that are God's&quot; (Matt. 22:21). In the end, when 
He completed on the cross the work of redemption whereby He achieved salvation 
and true freedom for men, He brought His revelation to completion. For He bore 
witness to the truth,(19) but He refused to impose the truth by force on those 
who spoke against it. Not by force of blows does His rule assert its claims.(20) 
It is established by witnessing to the truth and by hearing the truth, and it 
extends its dominion by the love whereby Christ, lifted up on the cross, draws 
all men to Himself.(21)</P>
<P>Taught by the word and example of Christ, the Apostles followed the same way. 
From the very origins of the Church the disciples of Christ strove to convert 
men to faith in Christ as the Lord; not, however, by the use of coercion or of 
devices unworthy of the Gospel, but by the power, above all, of the word of 
God.(22) Steadfastly they proclaimed to all the plan of God our Savior, &quot;who 
wills that all men should be saved and come to the acknowledgment of the truth&quot; 
(1 Tim. 2:4). At the same time, however, they showed respect for those of weaker 
stuff, even though they were in error, and thus they made it plain that &quot;each 
one of us is to render to God an account of himself&quot; (Romans 14:12),(23) and for 
that reason is bound to obey his conscience. Like Christ Himself, the Apostles 
were unceasingly bent upon bearing witness to the truth of God, and they showed 
the fullest measure of boldness in &quot;speaking the word with confidence&quot; (Acts 
4:31) (24) before the people and their rulers. With a firm faith they held that 
the Gospel is indeed the power of God unto salvation for all who believe.(25) 
Therefore they rejected all &quot;carnal weapons:(26) they followed the example of 
the gentleness and respectfulness of Christ and they preached the word of God in 
the full confidence that there was resident in this word itself a divine power 
able to destroy all the forces arrayed against God(27) and bring men to faith in 
Christ and to His service.(28) As the Master, so too the Apostles recognized 
legitimate civil authority. &quot;For there is no power except from God&quot;, the Apostle 
teaches, and thereafter commands: &quot;Let everyone be subject to higher 
authorities.... He who resists authority resists God's ordinance&quot; (Romans 
13:1-5).(29) At the same time, however, they did not hesitate to speak out 
against governing powers which set themselves in opposition to the holy will of 
God: &quot;It is necessary to obey God rather than men&quot; (Acts 5:29).(30) This is the 
way along which the martyrs and other faithful have walked through all ages and 
over all the earth.</P>
<P>12. In faithfulness therefore to the truth of the Gospel, the Church is 
following the way of Christ and the apostles when she recognizes and gives 
support to the principle of religious freedom as befitting the dignity of man 
and as being in accord with divine revelation. Throughout the ages the Church 
has kept safe and handed on the doctrine received from the Master and from the 
apostles. In the life of the People of God, as it has made its pilgrim way 
through the vicissitudes of human history, there has at times appeared a way of 
acting that was hardly in accord with the spirit of the Gospel or even opposed 
to it. Nevertheless, the doctrine of the Church that no one is to be coerced 
into faith has always stood firm.</P>
<P>Thus the leaven of the Gospel has long been about its quiet work in the minds 
of men, and to it is due in great measure the fact that in the course of time 
men have come more widely to recognize their dignity as persons, and the 
conviction has grown stronger that the person in society is to be kept free from 
all manner of coercion in matters religious.</P>
<P>13. Among the things that concern the good of the Church and indeed the 
welfare of society here on earth-things therefore that are always and everywhere 
to be kept secure and defended against all injury-this certainly is preeminent, 
namely, that the Church should enjoy that full measure of freedom which her care 
for the salvation of men requires.(31) This is a sacred freedom, because the 
only-begotten Son endowed with it the Church which He purchased with His blood. 
Indeed it is so much the property of the Church that to act against it is to act 
against the will of God. The freedom of the Church is the fundamental principle 
in what concerns the relations between the Church and governments and the whole 
civil order.</P>
<P>In human society and in the face of government the Church claims freedom for 
herself in her character as a spiritual authority, established by Christ the 
Lord, upon which there rests, by divine mandate, the duty of going out into the 
whole world and preaching the Gospel to every creature.(32) The Church also 
claims freedom for herself in her character as a society of men who have the 
right to live in society in accordance with the precepts of the Christian 
faith.(33)</P>
<P>In turn, where the principle of religious freedom is not only proclaimed in 
words or simply incorporated in law but also given sincere and practical 
application, there the Church succeeds in achieving a stable situation of right 
as well as of fact and the independence which is necessary for the fulfillment 
of her divine mission.</P>
<P>This independence is precisely what the authorities of the Church claim in 
society.(34) At the same time, the Christian faithful, in common with all other 
men, possess the civil right not to be hindered in leading their lives in 
accordance with their consciences. Therefore, a harmony exists between the 
freedom of the Church and the religious freedom which is to be recognized as the 
right of all men and communities and sanctioned by constitutional law. </P>
<P>14. In order to be faithful to the divine command, &quot;teach all nations&quot; (Matt. 
28:19-20), the Catholic Church must work with all urgency and concern &quot;that the 
word of God be spread abroad and glorified&quot; (2 Thess. 3:1). Hence the Church 
earnestly begs of its children that, &quot;first of all, supplications, prayers, 
petitions, acts of thanksgiving be made for all men.... For this is good and 
agreeable in the sight of God our Savior, who wills that all men be saved and 
come to the knowledge of the truth&quot; (1 Tim. 2:1-4). In the formation of their 
consciences, the Christian faithful ought carefully to attend to the sacred and 
certain doctrine of the Church.(35) For the Church is, by the will of Christ, 
the teacher of the truth. It is her duty to give utterance to, and 
authoritatively to teach, that truth which is Christ Himself, and also to 
declare and confirm by her authority those principles of the moral order which 
have their origins in human nature itself. Furthermore, let Christians walk in 
wisdom in the face of those outside, &quot;in the Holy Spirit, in unaffected love, in 
the word of truth&quot; (2 Cor. 6:6-7), and let them be about their task of spreading 
the light of life with all confidence(36) and apostolic courage, even to the 
shedding of their blood.</P>
<P>The disciple is bound by a grave obligation toward Christ, his Master, ever 
more fully to understand the truth received from Him, faithfully to proclaim it, 
and vigorously to defend it, never-be it understood-having recourse to means 
that are incompatible with the spirit of the Gospel. At the same time, the 
charity of Christ urges him to love and have prudence and patience in his 
dealings with those who are in error or in ignorance with regard to the 
faith.(37) All is to be taken into account-the Christian duty to Christ, the 
life-giving word which must be proclaimed, the rights of the human person, and 
the measure of grace granted by God through Christ to men who are invited freely 
to accept and profess the faith.</P>
<P>15. The fact is that men of the present day want to be able freely to profess 
their religion in private and in public. Indeed, religious freedom has already 
been declared to be a civil right in most constitutions, and it is solemnly 
recognized in international documents.(38) The further fact is that forms of 
government still exist under which, even though freedom of religious worship 
receives constitutional recognition, the powers of government are engaged in the 
effort to deter citizens from the profession of religion and to make life very 
difficult and dangerous for religious communities.</P>
<P>This council greets with joy the first of these two facts as among the signs 
of the times. With sorrow, however, it denounces the other fact, as only to be 
deplored. The council exhorts Catholics, and it directs a plea to all men, most 
carefully to consider how greatly necessary religious freedom is, especially in 
the present condition of the human family. All nations are coming into even 
closer unity. Men of different cultures and religions are being brought together 
in closer relationships. There is a growing consciousness of the personal 
responsibility that every man has. All this is evident. Consequently, in order 
that relationships of peace and harmony be established and maintained within the 
whole of mankind, it is necessary that religious freedom be everywhere provided 
with an effective constitutional guarantee and that respect be shown for the 
high duty and right of man freely to lead his religious life in society.</P>
<P>May the God and Father of all grant that the human family, through careful 
observance of the principle of religious freedom in society, may be brought by 
the grace of Christ and the power of the Holy Spirit to the sublime and unending 
and &quot;glorious freedom of the sons of God&quot; (Rom. 8:21).</P>
