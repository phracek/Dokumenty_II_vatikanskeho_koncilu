<CENTER>
<B>PREAMBLE</B></CENTER>
<P>1. The Catholic Church holds in high esteem the institutions, liturgical 
rites, ecclesiastical traditions and the established standards of the Christian 
life of the Eastern Churches, for in them, distinguished as they are for their 
venerable antiquity, there remains conspicuous the tradition that has been 
handed down from the Apostles through the Fathers (1) and that forms part of the 
divinely revealed and undivided heritage of the universal Church. This Sacred 
Ecumenical Council, therefore, in its care for the Eastern Churches which bear 
living witness to this tradition, in order that they may flourish and with new 
apostolic vigor execute the task entrusted to them, has determined to lay down a 
number of principles, in addition to those which refer to the universal Church; 
all else is remitted to the care of the Eastern synods and of the Holy See. 
</P>
<CENTER>
<B>THE INDIVIDUAL CHURCHES OR RITES 
</B></CENTER>
<P>2. The Holy Catholic Church, which is the Mystical Body of Christ, is made up 
of the faithful who are organically united in the Holy Spirit by the same faith, 
the same sacraments and the same government and who, combining together into 
various groups which are held together by a hierarchy, form separate Churches or 
Rites. Between these there exists an admirable bond of union, such that the 
variety within the Church in no way harms its unity; rather it manifests it, for 
it is the mind of the Catholic Church that each individual Church or Rite should 
retain its traditions whole and entire and likewise that it should adapt its way 
of life to the different needs of time and place.(2)
</P>
<P>3. These individual Churches, whether of the East or the West, although they 
differ somewhat among themselves in rite (to use the current phrase), that is, 
in liturgy, ecclesiastical discipline, and spiritual heritage, are, 
nevertheless, each as much as the others, entrusted to the pastoral government 
of the Roman Pontiff, the divinely appointed successor of St. Peter in primacy 
over the universal Church. They are consequently of equal dignity, so that none 
of them is superior to the others as regards rite and they enjoy the same rights 
and are under the same obligations, also in respect of preaching the Gospel to 
the whole world (cf. Mark 16, 15) under the guidance of the Roman Pontiff.
</P>
<P> 4. Means should be taken therefore in every part of the world for the 
protection and advancement of all the individual Churches and, to this end, 
there should be established parishes and a special hierarchy where the spiritual 
good of the faithful demands it. The hierarchs of the different individual 
Churches with jurisdiction in one and the same territory should, by taking 
common counsel in regular meetings, strive to promote unity of action and with 
common endeavor to sustain common tasks, so as better to further the good of 
religion and to safeguard more effectively the ordered way of life of the 
clergy.(3)
</P>
<P>All clerics and those aspiring to sacred Orders should be instructed in the 
rites and especially in the practical norms that must be applied in interritual 
questions. The laity, too, should be taught as part of its catechetical 
education about rites and their rules.</P>
<P>Finally, each and every Catholic, as also the baptized of every non-Catholic 
church or denomination who enters into the fullness of the Catholic communion, 
must retain his own rite wherever he is, must cherish it and observe it to the 
best of his ability (4), without prejudice to the right in special cases of 
persons, communities or areas, to have recourse to the Apostolic See, which, as the 
supreme judge of interchurch relations, will, acting itself or through other 
authorities, meet the needs of the occasion in an ecumenical spirit, by the 
issuance of opportune directives, decrees or rescripts.    </P>
<CENTER>
<B>PRESERVATION OF THE SPIRITUAL HERITAGE OF THE EASTERN CHURCHES </B></CENTER>
<P>5. History, tradition and abundant ecclesiastical institutions bear 
outstanding witness to the great merit owing to the Eastern Churches by the 
universal Church.(5) The Sacred Council, therefore, not only accords to this 
ecclesiastical and spiritual heritage the high regard which is its due and 
rightful praise, but also unhesitatingly looks on it as the heritage of the 
universal Church. For this reason it solemnly declares that the Churches of the 
East, as much as those of the West, have a full right and are in duty bound to 
rule themselves, each in accordance with its own established disciplines, since 
all these are praiseworthy by reason of their venerable antiquity, more 
harmonious with the character of their faithful and more suited to the promotion 
of the good of souls.</P>
<P>6. All members of the Eastern Rite should know and be convinced that they can 
and should always preserve their legitimate liturgical rite and their 
established way of life, and that these may not be altered except to obtain for 
themselves an organic improvement. All these, then, must be observed by the 
members of the Eastern rites themselves. Besides, they should attain to an ever 
greater knowledge and a more exact use of them, and, if in their regard they 
have fallen short owing to contingencies of times and persons, they should take 
steps to return to their ancestral traditions. </P>
<P>Those who, by reason of their office or apostolic ministries, are in frequent 
communication with the Eastern Churches or their faithful should be instructed 
according as their office demands in the knowledge and veneration of the rites, 
discipline, doctrine, history and character of the members of the Eastern 
rites.(6) To enhance the efficacy of their apostolate, Religious and 
associations of the Latin Rite working in Eastern countries or among Eastern 
faithful are earnestly counseled to found houses or even provinces of the 
Eastern rite, as far as this can be done.(7)  </P>
<CENTER>
<B>EASTERN RITE PATRIARCHS</B> </CENTER>
<P>7. The patriarchate, as an institution, has existed in the Church from the 
earliest times and was recognized by the first ecumenical councils.(8)</P>
<P>By the name Eastern patriarch, is meant the bishop to whom belongs 
jurisdiction over all bishops, not excepting metropolitans, clergy and people of 
his own territory or rite, in accordance with canon law and without prejudice to 
the primacy of the Roman Pontiff.(9)</P>
<P>Wherever a hierarch of any rite is appointed outside the territorial bounds 
of the patriarchate, he remains attached to the hierarchy of the patriarchate of 
that rite, in accordance with canon law.</P>
<P>8. Though some of the patriarchates of the Eastern Churches are of earlier 
and some of later date, nonetheless all are equal in respect of patriarchal 
dignity, without however prejudice to the legitimately established precedence of 
honor.(10)</P>
<P>9. By the most ancient tradition of the Church the patriarchs of the Eastern 
Churches are to be accorded special honor, seeing that each is set over his 
patriarchate as father and head.</P>
<P>This Sacred Council, therefore, determines that their rights and privileges 
should be re-established in accordance with the ancient tradition of each of the 
Churches and the decrees of the ecumenical councils.(11)</P>
<P>The rights and privileges in question are those that obtained in the time of 
union between East and West; though they should be adapted somewhat to modern 
conditions.</P>
<P>The patriarchs with their synods are the highest authority for all business 
of the patriarchate, including the right of establishing new eparchies and of 
nominating bishops of their rite within the territorial bounds of the 
patriarchate, without prejudice to the inalienable right of the Roman Pontiff to 
intervene in individual cases.</P>
<P>10. What has been said of patriarchs is valid also, in harmony with the canon 
law, in respect to major archbishops, who rule the whole of some individual 
church or rite.(12)</P>
<P>11. Seeing that the patriarchal office in the Eastern Church is a traditional 
form of government, the Sacred Ecumenical Council ardently desires that new 
patriarchates should be erected where there is need, to be established either by 
an ecumenical council or by the Roman Pontiff.(13)  </P>
<CENTER>
<B>THE DISCIPLINE OF THE SACRAMENTS</B> </CENTER>
<P>12. The Sacred Ecumenical Council confirms and approves the ancient 
discipline of the sacraments existing in the Oriental Churches, as also the 
ritual practices connected with their celebration and administration and 
ardently desires that this should be re-established if circumstances warrant it.</P>
<P>13. The established practice in respect of the minister of Confirmation that 
has obtained from most early times in the Eastern Church should be fully 
restored. Therefore, priests validly confer this sacrament, using chrism blessed 
by a patriarch or a bishop.(14)</P>
<P>14. All Eastern Rite priests, either in conjunction with Baptism or 
separately from it, can confer this sacrament validly on all the faithful of any 
rite including the Latin; licitly, however, only if the regulations both of the 
common and the particular law are observed.(15) Priests, also, of the Latin Rite, in 
accordance with the faculties they enjoy in respect to the administration of 
this sacrament, validly administer it also to the faithful of Eastern Churches; 
without prejudice to the rite, observing in regard to licitness the regulations 
both of the common and of the particular law.(16)</P>
<P>15. The faithful are bound to take part on Sundays and feast days in the 
Divine Liturgy or, according to the regulations or custom of their own rite, in 
the celebration of the Divine Office.(17) That the faithful may be able more 
easily to fulfill their obligation, it is laid down that the period of time 
within which the precept should be observed extends from the Vespers of the 
vigil to the end of the Sunday or the feast day.(18) The faithful are earnestly 
exhorted to receive Holy Communion on these days, and indeed more 
frequently-yes, even daily.(19)</P>
<P>16. Owing to the fact that the faithful of the different individual churches 
dwell intermingled with each other in the same area or Eastern territory, the 
faculties for hearing confessions duly and without restriction given to priests 
of any rite by their own hierarchs extend to the whole territory of him who 
grants them and also to the places and faithful of any other rite in the same 
territory, unless the hierarch of the place has expressly excluded this for 
places of his rite.(20)</P>
<P>17. In order that the ancient established practice of the Sacrament of Orders 
in the Eastern Churches may flourish again, this Sacred Council ardently desires 
that the office of the permanent diaconate should, where it has fallen into 
disuse, be restored.(21) The legislative authorities of each individual church 
should decide about the subdiaconate and the minor orders and the rights and 
obligations that attach to them.(22) </P>
<P>18. To obviate invalid marriages when Eastern Catholics marry baptized 
Eastern non-Catholics and in order to promote fidelity in and the sanctity of 
marriage, as well as peace within the family, the Sacred Council determines that 
the canonical &quot;form&quot; for the celebration of these marriages is of obligation 
only for liceity; for their validity the presence of a sacred minister is 
sufficient, provided that other prescriptions of law are observed.(23)  </P>
<CENTER>
<B>DIVINE WORSHIP </B></CENTER>
<P>19. It belongs only to an ecumenical council or to the Apostolic See to 
determine, transfer or suppress feast days common to all the Eastern Churches. 
On the other hand, to determine, transfer or suppress the feast days of any of 
the individual churches is within the competence not only of the Apostolic See 
but also of the patriarchal or archiepiscopal synod, due regard being had to the 
whole area and the other individual churches.(24)</P>
<P>20. Until such time as all Christians are agreed on a fixed day for the 
celebration of Easter, with a view meantime to promoting unity among the 
Christians of the same area or nation, it is left to the patriarchs or supreme 
authorities of a place to come to an agreement by the unanimous consent and 
combined counsel of those affected to celebrate the feast of Easter on the same 
Sunday.(25)</P>
<P>21. Individual faithful dwelling outside the area or territory of their own 
rite may follow completely the established custom of the place where they live 
as regards the law of the sacred seasons. In families of mixed rite it is 
permissible to observe this law according to one and the same rite.(26)</P>
<P>22. Eastern clerics and Religious should celebrate in accordance with the 
prescriptions and traditions of their own established custom the Divine Office, 
which from ancient times has been held in high honor in all Eastern 
Churches.(27) The faithful too should follow the example of their forebears and 
assist devoutly as occasion allows at the Divine Office.</P>
<P>23. It belongs to the patriarch with his synod, or to the supreme authority 
of each church with the council of the hierarchs, to regulate the use of 
languages in the sacred liturgical functions and, after reference to the 
Apostolic See, of approving translations of texts into the vernacular.(28)  </P>
<CENTER>
<B>RELATIONS WITH THE BRETHREN OF THE SEPARATED CHURCHES</B> </CENTER>
<P>24. The Eastern Churches in communion with the Apostolic See of Rome have a 
special duty of promoting the unity of all Christians, especially Eastern 
Christians, in accordance with the principles of the decree, &quot;About Ecumenism,&quot; 
of this Sacred Council, by prayer in the first place, and by the example of 
their lives, by religious fidelity to the ancient Eastern traditions, by a 
greater knowledge of each other, by collaboration and a brotherly regard for 
objects and feelings.(29)</P>
<P>25. If any separated Eastern Christian should, under the guidance of the 
grace of the Holy Spirit, join himself to the unity of Catholics, no more should 
be required of him than what a bare profession of the Catholic faith demands. 
Eastern clerics, seeing that a valid priesthood is preserved among them, are 
permitted to exercise the Orders they possess on joining the unity of the 
Catholic Church, in accordance with the regulations established by the competent 
authority.(30)</P>
<P>26. Common participation in worship (<em>communicatio in sacris</em>) which harms the 
unity of the Church or involves formal acceptance of error or the danger of 
aberration in the faith, of scandal and indifferentism, is forbidden by divine 
law.(32) On the other hand, pastoral experience shows clearly that, as regards 
our Eastern brethren, there should be taken into consideration the different 
cases of individuals, where neither the unity of the Church is hurt nor are 
verified the dangers that must be avoided, but where the needs of the salvation 
of souls and their spiritual good are impelling motives. For that reason the 
Catholic Church has always adopted and now adopts rather a mild policy, offering 
to all the means of salvation and an example of charity among Christians, 
through participation in the sacraments and in other sacred functions and 
things. With this in mind, &quot;lest because of the harshness of our judgment we be 
an obstacle to those seeking salvation&quot; (31) and in order more and more to 
promote union with the Eastern Churches separated from us, the Sacred Council 
lays down the following policy.</P>
<P>27. Without prejudice to the principles noted earlier, Eastern Christians who 
are in fact separated in good faith from the Catholic Church, if they ask of 
their own accord and have the right dispositions, may be admitted to the 
sacraments of Penance, the Eucharist and the Anointing of the Sick. Further, 
Catholics may ask for these same sacraments from those non-Catholic ministers 
whose churches possess valid sacraments, as often as necessity or a genuine 
spiritual benefit recommends such a course and access to a Catholic priest is 
physically or morally impossible.(33)</P>
<P>28. Further, given the same principles, common participation by Catholics 
with their Eastern separated brethren in sacred functions, things and places is 
allowed for a just cause.(34)</P>
<P>29. This conciliatory policy with regard to <em>communicatio in sacris</em> 
(participation in things sacred) with the brethren of the separated Eastern 
Churches is put into the care and control of the local hierarchs, in order that, 
by combined counsel among themselves and, if need be, after consultation also 
with the hierarchs of the separated churches, they may by timely and effective 
regulations and norms direct the relations among Christians.   </P>
<CENTER>
<B>CONCLUSION </B></CENTER>
<P>30. The Sacred Council feels great joy in the fruitful zealous collaboration 
of the Eastern and the Western Catholic Churches and at the same time declares: 
All these directives of law are laid down in view of the present situation until such time as the Catholic Church and the separated Eastern Churches come 
together into complete unity.  </P>
<P>Meanwhile, however, all Christians, Eastern as well as Western, are earnestly 
asked to pray to God fervently and assiduously, nay, indeed daily, that, with 
the aid of the most holy Mother of God, all may become one. Let them pray also 
that the strength and the consolation of the Holy Spirit may descend copiously 
upon all those many Christians of whatsoever church they be who endure suffering 
and deprivations for their unwavering avowal of the name of Christ.</P>
<P>&quot;Love one another with fraternal charity, anticipating one another with 
honor&quot; (Rom.12:10).</P>
<P>Each and all these matters which are set forth in this decree have been 
favorably voted on by the Fathers of the Council. And we, by the apostolic 
authority given us by Christ and in union with the Fathers, approve, decree and 
establish them in the Holy Spirit and command that they be promulgated for the 
glory of God.</P>
