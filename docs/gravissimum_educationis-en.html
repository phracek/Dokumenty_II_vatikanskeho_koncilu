<CENTER>
&nbsp;<P><B>INTRODUCTION</B></P></CENTER>
<P>The Sacred Ecumenical Council has considered with care how extremely 
important education is in the life of man and how its influence ever grows in 
the social progress of this age.(1)</P>
<P>Indeed, the circumstances of our time have made it easier and at once more 
urgent to educate young people and, what is more, to continue the education of 
adults. Men are more aware of their own dignity and position; more and more they 
want to take an active part in social and especially in economic and political 
life.(2) Enjoying more leisure, as they sometimes do, men find that the 
remarkable development of technology and scientific investigation and the new 
means of communication offer them an opportunity of attaining more easily their 
cultural and spiritual inheritance and of fulfilling one another in the closer 
ties between groups and even between peoples.</P>
<P>Consequently, attempts are being made everywhere to promote more education. 
The rights of men to an education, particularly the primary rights of children 
and parents, are being proclaimed and recognized in public documents.(3) As the 
number of pupils rapidly increases, schools are multiplied and expanded far and 
wide and other educational institutions are established. New experiments are 
conducted in methods of education and teaching. Mighty attempts are being made 
to obtain education for all, even though vast numbers of children and young 
people are still deprived of even rudimentary training and so many others lack a 
suitable education in which truth and love are developed together.</P>
<P>To fulfill the mandate she has received from her divine founder of 
proclaiming the mystery of salvation to all men and of restoring all things in 
Christ, Holy Mother the Church must be concerned with the whole of man's life, 
even the secular part of it insofar as it has a bearing on his heavenly 
calling.(4) Therefore she has a role in the progress and development of 
education. Hence this sacred synod declares certain fundamental principles of 
Christian education especially in schools. These principles will have to be 
developed at greater length by a special post-conciliar commission and applied 
by episcopal conferences to varying local situations.   </P>
<P><I><B> 1. The Meaning of the Universal Right to an Education </B></I> </P>
<P>All men of every race, condition and age, since they enjoy the dignity of a 
human being, have an inalienable right to an education (5) that is in keeping 
with their ultimate goal,(6) their ability, their sex, and the culture and 
tradition of their country, and also in harmony with their fraternal association 
with other peoples in the fostering of true unity and peace on earth. For a true 
education aims at the formation of the human person in the pursuit of his 
ultimate end and of the good of the societies of which, as man, he is a member, 
and in whose obligations, as an adult, he will share.</P>
<P>Therefore children and young people must be helped, with the aid of the 
latest advances in psychology and the arts and science of teaching, to develop 
harmoniously their physical, moral and intellectual endowments so that they may 
gradually acquire a mature sense of responsibility in striving endlessly to form 
their own lives properly and in pursuing true freedom as they surmount the 
vicissitudes of life with courage and constancy. Let them be given also, as they 
advance in years, a positive and prudent sexual education. Moreover they should 
be so trained to take their part in social life that properly instructed in the 
necessary and opportune skills they can become actively involved in various 
community organizations, open to discourse with others and willing to do their 
best to promote the common good.</P>
<P>This sacred synod likewise declares that children and young people have a 
right to be motivated to appraise moral values with a right conscience, to 
embrace them with a personal adherence, together with a deeper knowledge and 
love of God. Consequently it earnestly entreats all those who hold a position of 
public authority or who are in charge of education to see to it that youth is 
never deprived of this sacred right. It further exhorts the sons of the Church 
to give their attention with generosity to the entire field of education, having 
especially in mind the need of extending very soon the benefits of a suitable 
education and training to everyone in all parts of the world.(7)   </P>
<P><I><B> 2. Christian Education</B></I>  </P>
<P>Since all Christians have become by rebirth of water and the Holy Spirit a 
new creature(8) so that they should be called and should be children of God, 
they have a right to a Christian education. A Christian education does not 
merely strive for the maturing of a human person as just now described, but has 
as its principal purpose this goal: that the baptized, while they are gradually 
introduced the knowledge of the mystery of salvation, become ever more aware of 
the gift of Faith they have received, and that they learn in addition how to 
worship God the Father in spirit and truth (cf. John 4:23) especially in 
liturgical action, and be conformed in their personal lives according to the new 
man created in justice and holiness of truth (Eph. 4:22-24); also that they 
develop into perfect manhood, to the mature measure of the fullness of Christ 
(cf. Eph. 4:13) and strive for the growth of the Mystical Body; moreover, that 
aware of their calling, they learn not only how to bear witness to the hope that 
is in them (cf. Peter 3:15) but also how to help in the Christian formation of 
the world that takes place when natural powers viewed in the full consideration 
of man redeemed by Christ contribute to the good of the whole society.(9) 
Wherefore this sacred synod recalls to pastors of souls their most serious 
obligation to see to it that all the faithful, but especially the youth who are 
the hope of the Church, enjoy this Christian education.(10)   </P>
<P><I><B> 3. The Authors of Education</B></I>  </P>
<P>Since parents have given children their life, they are bound by the most 
serious obligation to educate their offspring and therefore must be recognized 
as the primary and principal educators.(11) This role in education is so 
important that only with difficulty can it be supplied where it is lacking. 
Parents are the ones who must create a family atmosphere animated by love and 
respect for God and man, in which the well-rounded personal and social education 
of children is fostered. Hence the family is the first school of the social 
virtues that every society needs. It is particularly in the Christian family, 
enriched by the grace and office of the sacrament of matrimony, that children 
should be taught from their early years to have a knowledge of God according to 
the faith received in Baptism, to worship Him, and to love their neighbor. Here, 
too, they find their first experience of a wholesome human society and of the 
Church. Finally, it is through the family that they are gradually led to a 
companionship with their fellowmen and with the people of God. Let parents, 
then, recognize the inestimable importance a truly Christian family has for the 
life and progress of God's own people.(12)</P>
<P>The family which has the primary duty of imparting education needs help of 
the whole community. In addition, therefore, to the rights of parents and others 
to whom the parents entrust a share in the work of education, certain rights and 
duties belong indeed to civil society, whose role is to direct what is required 
for the common temporal good. Its function is to promote the education of youth 
in many ways, namely: to protect the duties and rights of parents and others who 
share in education and to give them aid; according to the principle of 
subsidiarity, when the endeavors of parents and other societies are lacking, to 
carry out the work of education in accordance with the wishes of the parents; 
and, moreover, as the common good demands, to build schools and 
institutions.(13) </P>
<P>Finally, in a special way, the duty of educating belongs to the Church, not 
merely because she must be recognized as a human society capable of educating, 
but especially because she has the responsibility of announcing the way of 
salvation to all men, of communicating the life of Christ to those who believe, 
and, in her unfailing solicitude, of assisting men to be able to come to the 
fullness of this life.(14) The Church is bound as a mother to give to these 
children of hers an education by which their whole life can be imbued with the 
spirit of Christ and at the same time do all she can to promote for all peoples 
the complete perfection of the human person, the good of earthly society and the 
building of a world that is more human.(15)    </P>
<P><B><I>4. Various Aids to Christian Education</I></B>  </P>
<P>In fulfilling its educational role, the Church, eager to employ all suitable 
aids, is concerned especially about those which are her very own. Foremost among 
these is catechetical instruction,(16) which enlightens and strengthens the 
faith, nourishes life according to the spirit of Christ, leads to intelligent 
and active participation in the liturgical mystery(17) and gives motivation for 
apostolic activity. The Church esteems highly and seeks to penetrate and ennoble 
with her own spirit also other aids which belong to the general heritage of man 
and which are of great influence in forming souls and molding men, such as the 
media of communication,(18) various groups for mental and physical development, 
youth associations, and, in particular, schools.   
</P>
<P><B><I>5. The Importance of Schools</I></B>  </P>
<P>Among all educational instruments the school has a special importance.(19) It 
is designed not only to develop with special care the intellectual faculties but 
also to form the ability to judge rightly, to hand on the cultural legacy of 
previous generations, to foster a sense of values, to prepare for professional 
life. Between pupils of different talents and backgrounds it promotes friendly 
relations and fosters a spirit of mutual understanding; and it establishes as it 
were a center whose work and progress must be shared together by families, 
teachers, associations of various types that foster cultural, civic, and 
religious life, as well as by civil society and the entire human community.</P>
<P>Beautiful indeed and of great importance is the vocation of all those who aid 
parents in fulfilling their duties and who, as representatives of the human 
community, undertake the task of education in schools. This vocation demands 
special qualities of mind and heart, very careful preparation, and continuing 
readiness to renew and to adapt.    </P>
<P><B><I>6. The Duties and Rights of Parents </I></B> </P>
<P>Parents who have the primary and inalienable right and duty to educate their 
children must enjoy true liberty in their choice of schools. Consequently, the 
public power, which has the obligation to protect and defend the rights of 
citizens, must see to it, in its concern for distributive justice, that public 
subsidies are paid out in such a way that parents are truly free to choose 
according to their conscience the schools they want for their children.(20)</P>
<P>In addition it is the task of the state to see to it that all citizens are 
able to come to a suitable share in culture and are properly prepared to 
exercise their civic duties and rights. Therefore the state must protect the 
right of children to an adequate school education, check on the ability of 
teachers and the excellence of their training, look after the health of the 
pupils and in general, promote the whole school project. But it must always keep 
in mind the principle of subsidiarity so that there is no kind of school 
monopoly, for this is opposed to the native rights of the human person, to the 
development and spread of culture, to the peaceful association of citizens and 
to the pluralism that exists today in ever so many societies.(21)</P>
<P>Therefore this sacred synod exhorts the faithful to assist to their utmost in 
finding suitable methods of education and programs of study and in forming 
teachers who can give youth a true education. Through the associations of 
parents in particular they should further with their assistance all the work of 
the school but especially the moral education it must impart.(22)    </P>
<P><B><I>7. Moral and Religious Education in all Schools</I></B>  </P>
<P>Feeling very keenly the weighty responsibility of diligently caring for the 
moral and religious education of all her children, the Church must be present 
with her own special affection and help for the great number who are being 
trained in schools that are not Catholic. This is possible by the witness of the 
lives of those who teach and direct them, by the apostolic action of their 
fellow-students,(23) but especially by the ministry of priests and laymen who 
give them the doctrine of salvation in a way suited to their age and 
circumstances and provide spiritual aid in every way the times and conditions 
allow.</P>
<P>The Church reminds parents of the duty that is theirs to arrange and even 
demand that their children be able to enjoy these aids and advance in their 
Christian formation to a degree that is abreast of their development in secular 
subjects. Therefore the Church esteems highly those civil authorities and 
societies which, bearing in mind the pluralism of contemporary society and 
respecting religious freedom, assist families so that the education of their 
children can be imparted in all schools according to the individual moral and 
religious principles of the families.(24)    </P>
<P><B><I>8. Catholic Schools</I></B>  </P>
<P>The influence of the Church in the field of education is shown in a special 
manner by the Catholic school. No less than other schools does the Catholic 
school pursue cultural goals and the human formation of youth. But its proper 
function is to create for the school community a special atmosphere animated by 
the Gospel spirit of freedom and charity, to help youth grow according to the 
new creatures they were made through baptism as they develop their own 
personalities, and finally to order the whole of human culture to the news of 
salvation so that the knowledge the students gradually acquire of the world, 
life and man is illumined by faith.(25) So indeed the Catholic school, while it 
is open, as it must be, to the situation of the contemporary world, leads its 
students to promote efficaciously the good of the earthly city and also prepares 
them for service in the spread of the Kingdom of God, so that by leading an 
exemplary apostolic life they become, as it were, a saving leaven in the human 
community.</P>
<P>Since, therefore, the Catholic school can be such an aid to the fulfillment 
of the mission of the People of God and to the fostering of the dialogue between 
the Church and mankind, to the benefit of both, it retains even in our present 
circumstances the utmost importance. Consequently this sacred synod proclaims 
anew what has already been taught in several documents of the magisterium,(26) 
namely: the right of the Church freely to establish and to conduct schools of 
every type and level. And the council calls to mind that the exercise of a right 
of this kind contributes in the highest degree to the protection of freedom of 
conscience, the rights of parents, as well as to the betterment of culture 
itself.</P>
<P>But let teachers recognize that the Catholic school depends upon them almost 
entirely for the accomplishment of its goals and programs.(27) They should 
therefore be very carefully prepared so that both in secular and religious 
knowledge they are equipped with suitable qualifications and also with a 
pedagogical skill that is in keeping with the findings of the contemporary 
world. Intimately linked in charity to one another and to their students and 
endowed with an apostolic spirit, may teachers by their life as much as by their 
instruction bear witness to Christ, the unique Teacher. Let them work as 
partners with parents and together with them in every phase of education give 
due consideration to the difference of sex and the proper ends Divine Providence 
assigns to each sex in the family and in society. Let them do all they can to 
stimulate their students to act for themselves and even after graduation to 
continue to assist them with advice, friendship and by establishing special 
associations imbued with the true spirit of the Church. The work of these 
teachers, this sacred synod declares, is in the real sense of the word an 
apostolate most suited to and necessary for our times and at once a true service 
offered to society. The Council also reminds Catholic parents of the duty of 
entrusting their children to Catholic schools wherever and whenever it is 
possible and of supporting these schools to the best of their ability and of 
cooperating with them for the education of their children.(28)    </P>
<P><B><I>9. Different Types of Catholic Schools</I></B>  </P>
<P>To this concept of a Catholic school all schools that are in any way 
dependent on the Church must conform as far as possible, though the Catholic 
school is to take on different forms in keeping with local circumstances.(29) 
Thus the Church considers very dear to her heart those Catholic schools, found 
especially in the areas of the new churches, which are attended also by students 
who are not Catholics.</P>
<P>Attention should be paid to the needs of today in establishing and directing 
Catholic schools. Therefore, though primary and secondary schools, the 
foundation of education, must still be fostered, great importance is to be 
attached to those which are required in a particular way by contemporary 
conditions, such as: professional(30) and technical schools, centers for 
educating adults and promoting social welfare, or for the retarded in need of 
special care, and also schools for preparing teachers for religious instruction 
and other types of education.</P>
<P>This Sacred Council of the Church earnestly entreats pastors and all the 
faithful to spare no sacrifice in helping Catholic schools fulfill their 
function in a continually more perfect way, and especially in caring for the 
needs of those who are poor in the goods of this world or who are deprived of 
the assistance and affection of a family or who are strangers to the gift of 
Faith.    </P>
<P><B><I>10. Catholic Colleges and Universities</I></B>  </P>
<P>The Church is concerned also with schools of a higher level, especially 
colleges and universities. In those schools dependent on her she intends that by 
their very constitution individual subjects be pursued according to their own 
principles, method, and liberty of scientific inquiry, in such a way that an 
ever deeper understanding in these fields may be obtained and that, as questions 
that are new and current are raised and investigations carefully made according 
to the example of the doctors of the Church and especially of St. Thomas 
Aquinas,(31) there may be a deeper realization of the harmony of faith and 
science. Thus there is accomplished a public, enduring and pervasive influence 
of the Christian mind in the furtherance of culture and the students of these 
institutions are molded into men truly outstanding in their training, ready to 
undertake weighty responsibilities in society and witness to the faith in the 
world.(32)</P>
<P>In Catholic universities where there is no faculty of sacred theology there 
should be established an institute or chair of sacred theology in which there 
should be lectures suited to lay students. Since science advances by means of 
the investigations peculiar to higher scientific studies, special attention 
should be given in Catholic universities and colleges to institutes that serve 
primarily the development of scientific research.</P>
<P>The sacred synod heartily recommends that Catholic colleges and universities 
be conveniently located in different parts of the world, but in such a way that 
they are outstanding not for their numbers but for their pursuit of knowledge. 
Matriculation should be readily available to students of real promise, even 
though they be of slender means, especially to students from the newly emerging 
nations.</P>
<P>Since the destiny of society and of the Church itself is intimately linked 
with the progress of young people pursuing higher studies,(33) the pastors of 
the Church are to expend their energies not only on the spiritual life of 
students who attend Catholic universities, but, solicitous for the spiritual 
formation of all their children, they must see to it, after consultations 
between bishops, that even at universities that are not Catholic there should be 
associations and university centers under Catholic auspices in which priests, 
religious and laity, carefully selected and prepared, should give abiding 
spiritual and intellectual assistance to the youth of the university. Whether in 
Catholic universities or others, young people of greater ability who seem suited 
for teaching or research should be specially helped and encouraged to undertake 
a teaching career.     </P>
<P><B><I>11. Faculties of Sacred Sciences </I></B> </P>
<P>The Church expects much from the zealous endeavors of the faculties of the 
sacred sciences.(34) For to them she entrusts the very serious responsibility of 
preparing her own students not only for the priestly ministry, but especially 
for teaching in the seats of higher ecclesiastical studies or for promoting 
learning on their own or for undertaking the work of a more rigorous 
intellectual apostolate. Likewise it is the role of these very faculties to make 
more penetrating inquiry into the various aspects of the sacred sciences so that 
an ever deepening understanding of sacred Revelation is obtained, the legacy of 
Christian wisdom handed down by our forefathers is more fully developed, the 
dialogue with our separated brethren and with non-Christians is fostered, and 
answers are given to questions arising from the development of doctrine.(35)</P>
<P>Therefore ecclesiastical faculties should reappraise their own laws so that 
they can better promote the sacred sciences and those linked with them and, by 
employing up-to-date methods and aids, lead their students to more penetrating 
inquiry.    </P>
<P><B><I>12. Coordination to be Fostered in Scholastic Matters</I></B>  </P>
<P>Cooperation is the order of the day. It increases more and more to supply the 
demand on a diocesan, national and international level. Since it is altogether 
necessary in scholastic matters, every means should be employed to foster 
suitable cooperation between Catholic schools, and between these and other 
schools that collaboration should be developed which the good of all mankind 
requires.(36) From greater coordination and cooperative endeavor greater fruits 
will be derived particularly in the area of academic institutions. Therefore in 
every university let the various faculties work mutually to this end, insofar as 
their goal will permit. In addition, let the universities also endeavor to work 
together by promoting international gatherings, by sharing scientific inquiries 
with one another, by communicating their discoveries to one another, by having 
exchange of professors for a time and by promoting all else that is conducive to 
greater assistance.    </P>

<B>CONCLUSION</B>  </CENTER>
</FONT>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" size=3>
<P>The sacred synod earnestly entreats young people themselves to become aware 
of the importance of the work of education and to prepare themselves to take it 
up, especially where because of a shortage of teachers the education of youth is 
in jeopardy. This same sacred synod, while professing its gratitude to priests, 
Religious men and women, and the laity who by their evangelical self-dedication 
are devoted to the noble work of education and of schools of every type and 
level, exhorts them to persevere generously in the work they have undertaken 
and, imbuing their students with the spirit of Christ, to strive to excel in 
pedagogy and the pursuit of knowledge in such a way that they not merely advance 
the internal renewal of the Church but preserve and enhance its beneficent 
influence upon today's world, especially the intellectual world.   </P>
